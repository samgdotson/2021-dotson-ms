The need for transparency, repeatability, and robust uncertainty quantification
motivated \gls{temoa}'s development \cite{hunter_modeling_2013}.
In particular, model interrogation by third parties is essential to this transparency
goal. Nevertheless, complex models can be tens to hundreds of thousands of lines long.
The \texttt{US\_Regional.sql} database maintained by the \gls{temoa} team exceeds
150,000 lines \cite{model_databases_2021}. Even with an open-source
database viewer like \texttt{DBeaver}, checking a large dataset's assumptions can be
overwhelming \cite{noauthor_dbeaver_nodate}. Conversely, developing new datasets
for \gls{temoa} presents a steep learning curve for some new users or a time-consuming
endeavor for experienced ones. Updating model parameters or structure (e.g., number
of time slices or time periods) is tricky. Further, although \gls{temoa}
is capable of sensitivity analysis with \gls{mga}, \gls{mca}, and stochastic
optimization, only \gls{mga} is ``native'' to the framework. In fact, \gls{temoa}
currently only offers \gls{mga} sensitivity analysis on its cloud platform.

\gls{pygen} is a user-friendly wrapper for \gls{temoa}. \gls{pygen} was developed
to support the work in Chapter \ref{chapter:illinois} and Chapter \ref{chapter:uiuc}.
It facilitates reproducible model creation for energy system modeling.
I created \gls{pygen} to:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Automatically generate \gls{temoa} \texttt{SQL} databases and configuration files,
  \item Process time series.
  \item Calculate future demand growth.
  \item Facilitate sensitivity analysis using a templated approach.
  \item Be executable from the command line, anywhere
\end{enumerate}
\gls{pygen} allows users to interact with a few hundred lines of Python code rather
than an \texttt{SQL} database with tens of thousands of rows.
Figure \ref{fig:pygen-flow} shows the flow of data through \gls{pygen}.
A \gls{pygen} input file consists of three main components, simulation metadata,
\texttt{Technology} objects, and \texttt{Commodity} objects. These objects
contain all parameters, data, and units necessary to populate a \gls{temoa}
database. Further, since \gls{pygen} input files use Python, modelers
can directly interrogate model assumptions. For example, by plotting the demand
growth over time, or the learning curves for each technology, with the \gls{pygen}
input file.
\gls{pygen} adds clarity and usability while preserving \gls{temoa}'s flexibility.
A \gls{pygen} input file can be turned into a template using a liquid-text format
to specify uncertain parameters, and then hundreds of input files can be
populated with the \texttt{Jinja2} Python library \cite{noauthor_jinja_2022}.

\subsubsection{Time-Series Processing}
Automated conversion of continuous time series data into a \gls{temoa}-ready
time slices is one of \gls{pygen}' key features. By specifying the number of ``seasons''
and the number of ``times of day,'' users can quickly rerun their model at different
temporal resolutions. The only limit to this is computational tractability on
\gls{temoa}'s end. There are two options for time series processing, ``demand'' and
``capacity factor.'' A ``demand'' profile ensures the sum of all representative days is
unity, while a ``capacity factor'' profile divides each representative day by the
maximum value of the original time series.
Figure \ref{fig:solar-timeslice} shows some historical data from \gls{uiuc}'s
first solar farm project, Solar Farm 1.0 \cite{white_solar_2017}, that \gls{pygen}
sliced into four seasons with one representative day of 24 hours each, with ``capacity
factor'' specified.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{\input{figures/solar_timeslice.pgf}}
  \caption{Historical solar data (left) sliced into four seasons with one
  representative day of 24 hours each (right) for a \gls{temoa} model.}
  \label{fig:solar-timeslice}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:steam-timeslice} shows how \gls{pygen} slices time series
data with the ``demand'' option. Note that the \texttt{DemandSpecificDistribution}
corresponds to the fraction of annual demand that time slice represents. Since
there are 96 time slices in this example, the demand fraction is on the order of one
percent. Calculating either ``demand'' or ``capacity factor'' uses a time series
averaging approach where the average day of a particular time period is assumed
to be representative for all other days in that period \cite{kotzur_impact_2018}.
If the time series has multiple years of data, the data is further averaged
across all years.

  \caption{Historical steam demand data (left) sliced into four seasons with one
  representative day of 24 hours each (right) for a \gls{temoa} model.}
  \label{fig:steam-timeslice}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Demand Growth Forecasts}
Demand growth (or degrowth) rate is an explicit parameter in \gls{pygen}, enabling
sensitivity analysis over growth rate. Modelers can ask questions like
``how must electricity demand evolve if the cost of electricity is to remain
constant?'' Figure \ref{fig:dem-growth} shows the change in electricity demand
over time for various growth rates and growth curves. \gls{pygen} currently simulates
exponential or linear curves. In the future, this will extend to logistic curves
and user-defined curves.

  \caption{Different electricity demand futures under various growth rates and curves.}
  \label{fig:dem-growth}
\end{figure}

By making all model parameters explicit, \gls{pygen} makes truly global sensitivity
analysis possible. Indeed, the sensitivity analysis in Chapter \ref{chapter:illinois}
is prohibitively labor-intensive without \gls{pygen}.
