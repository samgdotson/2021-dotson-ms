The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign operates a diverse microgrid to
deliver electricity, steam heat, and chilled water to virtually all of its
campus buildings. This combination of demands makes full decarbonization difficult.
Nevertheless, UIUC adopted the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 for all energy sectors.

Figure \ref{fig:uiucsys} shows the topology of UIUCâ€™s energy system, modeled in Temoa.
The UIUC model is spatially simple, since there is only one region, but topologically
more complex than the Illinois model from Section \ref{section:ilmodel} with
three interconnected end-use demands.

\subsection{Model and Data}
All campus data were obtained from the Facilities and Services Department at \gls{uiuc}.
Cost and operational data were also retrieved from the \gls{uiuc} ''Utilities
Production and Distribution Master Plan'' \cite{affiliated_engineers_inc_utilities_2015}.
Table \ref{tab:uiuc-tech} summarizes the technologies and some key parameters
used in the \gls{temoa} model. Similar to the Illinois case study, all technologies have
an ``efficiency'' of unity because fuel resources are not modeled.
I analyzed the structural uncertainty of this model using \gls{mga}, which constructs
alternative futures that are not necessarily motivated by cost. Additionally,
as a research university, \gls{uiuc} is interested in developing pre-commercial
technologies (e.g. a geothermal loop for heating and cooling). For these reasons,
the technology learning curves are not applied in the \gls{uiuc} model.

\subsubsection{Campus Steam}
\gls{uiuc} heats most of its buildings with steam generated by natural gas and
coal plant on campus, \gls{abbott}. \gls{abbott} is a combined cycle facility that
can operate in a condensing mode to capture steam to generate electricity or an
extraction mode that sends steam to campus for heating
\cite{affiliated_engineers_inc_utilities_2015}. \gls{temoa} does not have a
convenient way to model combined cycle plants \cite{decarolis_temoa_2010}. The
\gls{temoa} team suggests splitting the output of the technology. However, this
forces the \gls{abbott} model to generate steam and electricity in a fixed ratio, which
is not how \gls{abbott} operates. I circumvent this issue by introducing a dummy
technology, \texttt{ABBOTT\_TB}, that converts steam to electricity. Thus, \gls{temoa}
must choose how to use the steam produced by \gls{abbott}, matching operational reality.
I modeled an on-campus nuclear reactor in a similar manner. The nuclear reactor
generates a unique commodity, \texttt{NUC\_STM}, to distinguish nuclear activity
from \gls{abbott}'s activity.

\subsubsection{Campus Electricity}

Electricity on campus comes primarily from electricity imports from the MISO
Interconnection or the natural gas and coal power plant located on campus,
\gls{abbott}. Some electricity comes from the campus solar farms and a power purchase
agreement with Rail Splitter Wind Farm
\cite{institute_for_sustainability_energy_and_environment_illinois_2015,breitweiser_wind_2016,white_solar_2017}.
In Figure \ref{fig:uiucsys}, steam from a nuclear reactor may generate
electricity with \texttt{NUCLEAR\_TB}.

\subsubsection{Campus Chilled Water}

As with heat, most buildings on campus are cooled with a chilled water system.
Most chillers use electricity, but there are a small number of seldom used
steam-driven chillers \cite{affiliated_engineers_inc_utilities_2015}. The latter
are not modeled in this work. \gls{uiuc} also has several chilled water storage
tanks to reduce peak demand loads.
