\label{app:pygen}
Code Listing \ref{code:sql} shows
the code \gls{temoa} requires to specify the model time horizon and time slices.
The \gls{pygen} equivalent is shown in code listing \ref{code:python}. Changing
the number of modeled ``seasons'' or years in the model horizon is non-trivial with
\gls{temoa} alone, especially since other tables, such as \texttt{CapacityFactorTech},
which specifies the availability of each technology at each time slice, depend
on the number of time slices and technologies (the product of ``number of seasons,''
``times of day,'' and number of technologies).
The example in code listing \ref{code:sql} produces 96 time slices, thus \texttt{CapacityFactorTech}
would have at least 96 rows for a single technology. With \gls{pygen}, users can
update the number of time slices and all affected tables with no additional lines
of code.
