This chapter introduces the software and tools used to conduct experiments in this
thesis. As well as describing the case studies and experiments themselves.
The tools I used were:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Tools for Energy System Optimization and Analysis (Temoa).
  \item Python for Generating Energy Systems (\pygen)
\end{itemize}
In this thesis, I demonstrate the role of advanced nuclear reactors to meet future
energy demands with two case studies: Illinoisâ€™ electric grid and the microgrid
at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Both case studies use \gls{temoa}
to solve for the optimal least-cost solution. I developed \gls{pygen} to
facilitate creation of \gls{temoa} input files and sensitivity analyses.
