The State of Illinois generates over half of its electricity with nuclear reactors
\cite{energy_information_administration_eia_nodate}.
Illinois also straddles two interconnections: \gls{miso} and PJM. The recent
passage of the CEJA bill commits Illinois to a policy of carbon-free electricity
by 2030 and 100\% renewable energy by 2050 \cite{harmon_climate_2021}.
I modeled a simplified version of the Illinois electric grid using \gls{temoa}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{IL_system.png}
  \caption{The Illinois electricity grid modeled in \gls{temoa}.}
  \label{fig:ilsys}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:ilsys} shows the model topology of the Illinois system. There
are nine different electricity generating technologies and one storage option.
All generated electricity passes through a \texttt{TRANSMISSION} technology
to simulate electricity delivery. The Illinois model is spatially and topologically
simple since there are only ten distinct technologies, one region, and one
end-use commodity.

The demand curve for the \texttt{ELC\_DEMAND} commodity is modeled with hourly load
data from the PJM Interconnection. Figure \ref{fig:pjm-elc} shows the historical
electricity demand for PJM and the associated load curve. These data inform the
distribution of annual demand in the \gls{temoa} model, which is scaled by the
total annual demand.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Scenarios}
I consider four scenarios in the Illinois case study. Each scenario imposes forces
all carbon emissions from the electric sector to zero in 2030. This reflects Illinois'
current policy goal of 100\% clean electricity by 2030 \cite{office_of_governor_jb_pritzker_gov_2021}.
Further, each scenario adds a new constraint on nuclear energy in Illinois. Table
\ref{tab:il-scenarios} summarizes these constraints.

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \caption{Summary of Illinois Case Study Scenarios}
  \label{tab:il-scenarios}
  \resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{
  \begin{tabular}{lrrrrr}
    \toprule
    Name & Abbreviation & Time Horizon & Zero Emissions Year& Linear Growth Rate & Note\\
    \midrule
    Least Cost & LC & 2025-2050 & 2030& 1.0\% & All technology options available\\
    Zero Advanced Nuclear  &ZAN &2025-2050 & 2030& 1.0\% & Advanced nuclear is explicitly disallowed\\
    Expensive Nuclear & XN & 2025-2050 & 2030& 1.0\% & Advanced nuclear capital costs doubled\\
    100\% Renewable & ZN &  2025-2050 &2030& 1.0\% & Nuclear energy is explicitly phased-out by 2050\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  }
\end{table}

The ``zero advanced nuclear'' scenario simulates the Illinois moratorium on new nuclear
power plants. The moratorium stipulates that no new nuclear reactors may be
commissioned in Illinois unless the United States Government offers a means to
dispose of high level nuclear waste, or by specific approval from the Illinois
General Assembly \cite{shea_states_2021}. The ``expensive nuclear'' scenario
simulates the \textit{expectation} of significant cost overruns for \textit{every}
new reactor build. Finally, the ``100\% renewable'' scenario reflects current
Illinois policy to have 100\% renewable energy, as written in the \gls{ceja} bill
\cite{harmon_climate_2021}. This policy implicitly requires the retirement of
all existing Illinois nuclear plants.

\subsection{Model and Data}

Table \ref{tab:il-tech} summarizes the technologies and some key parameters
used in the \gls{temoa} model. All technologies have an ``efficiency'' of unity
because fuel resources are treated as infinite reservoirs. The variable costs
include variable operating and management costs and cost of fuel. \gls{temoa}
implements technology ramp rates to improve operational detail and partially
close the gap between \glspl{esom} and unit-commitment models \cite{de_queiroz_repurposing_2019}.
Ramp rates limit the change in power output between time slices. For example
\texttt{NUCLEAR\_ADV} has a 25\% ramp rate, meaning it can increase or decrease
its power output by 25\% per hour, allowing for modest load following capability
\cite{baseload_2017,lokhov_technical_2011}. ``LC'' indicates that learning
curves were applied for a particular technology according to the 2020 Annual Technology
Baseline from NREL \cite{nrel_2020_2020}. These learning curves are shown in
Figure \ref{fig:costs}.

The 2020 Annual Technology Baseline has costs from 2018 to 2050. In this model
I assumed that costs remained flat before and after those years.

\subsection{Sensitivity Analysis}

\glspl{esom} typically use a time slice approach to reduce temporal complexity
in favor of greater topological or spatial complexity. Some work investigated the
influence of temporal resolution on model results. Poncelet et et al. 2016
concluded that modelers should prioritize temporal resolution over spatial and
topological detail, particularly with a significant penetration of \gls{vre}
sources like solar and wind \cite{poncelet_impact_2016}. However,
I am unaware of any literature that explicitly examined the annual variability
of solar and wind. \glspl{esom} like \gls{temoa} treat each year in a model
time horizon as identical with respect to demand curves and capacity factors. Yet
we know \textit{a priori} that energy demand and availability of \glspl{vre}
vary year-to-year. Thus, even a model that has a full year of hourly resolution
will fail to capture changes in the availability of solar and wind.

For the Illinois case study, I conducted two sensitivity analyses. First is a
sensitivity on time resolution. Poncelet et al. 2016 examined the influence of
the number of time slices, and how those time slices were chosen, on model results.
At most, they sliced time series into four seasons with three representative days (weekday,
Saturday, Sunday) and 24 times-of-day. Thus, they modeled 288 time slices. This
method captures variability in energy demand within the week, but is not guaranteed
to capture the variability of solar and wind -- which do not possess periodicity
associated with the day of the week. In this work, I consider three time resolutions,
each with one representative day. Table \ref{tab:time-slice} shows the different
time resolutions I considered in this thesis.

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \caption{Summary of Time Slices for Each Experiment}
  \label{tab:time-slice}
  \begin{tabular}{lrrrr}
    \toprule
    Experiment & Seasonal & Daily & Diurnal & Total\\
    \midrule
    Seasonal & 4 & 1 & 24 & 96\\
    Monthly & 12 & 1 & 24 & 288\\
    Weekly & 52 & 1 & 24 & 1248\\
    \midrule
    Poncelet et al. \cite{poncelet_impact_2016} & 4 & 3 &  24 & 288\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The second sensitivity analysis varies the distribution of solar and wind generation
each year. I retrieved historical wind speed and solar radiation data (\gls{ghi})
from the \gls{nsrdb} \cite{sengupta_national_2018} for the years 2010 to 2020.
The \gls{ghi} data can be converted to a capacity factor and used directly by
\gls{temoa} since
\begin{align}
  P_{solar} &\propto GHI.
\end{align}
Which makes sense since solar power is generated when the sun is out. However,
wind speed cannot be used directly since wind turbines have different operating
regimes, described in Table \ref{tab:turbine}

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \caption{Summary of Wind Turbine Data}
  \label{tab:turbine}

  \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{  \begin{tabular}{lrrrrrr}
    \toprule
    Turbine Model & Rated Power & Cut-in Speed & Rated Speed & Cut-out Speed & Rotor Height & Diameter\\
     & [MW] & [m/s] & [m/s] & [m/s] & [m] & [m]\\
    \midrule
    GE 1.5 MW Series & 1.5 & 3.5 & 12 & 25 & 80 & 77\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}}
\end{table}

Turbines capture no energy at wind speeds below the cut-in speed and, for safety
reasons, brakes are applied above at wind speeds above the cut-out wind speed
and no energy is captured. Between the rated speed and the cut-out speed, the
wind turbine generates its rated power. At all other times, the turbines produce
power according to
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:windpower}
  P_{turbine} &= \frac{1}{2}\eta\rho U^3 \left(\frac{\pi D^2}{4}\right),
  \intertext{where}
  P_{turbine} &= \text{power generated by the wind turbine},\nonumber\\
  \eta &= \text{wind turbine efficiency} \approx 0.35 \text{ } [-], \nonumber\\
  \rho &= \text{air density $\left[\frac{kg}{m^3}\right]$} \nonumber\\
  \label{eqn:airdensity}
  &= \frac{P_{dry}}{R_{dry}T} + \frac{P_{vapor}}{R_{vapor}T}, \\
  P_{dry}&= \text{vapor pressure of dry air [Pa]}, \nonumber\\
  P_{vapor}&= \text{vapor pressure of water [Pa]}, \nonumber\\
  &= e_s\cdot RH,\\
  RH &= \text{relative humidity [-]}\nonumber\\
  e_s &= 0.6112e^{\frac{17.67T}{T+243.5}} \text{ [Pa]}\\
  R_{dry}&= \text{specific gas constant for dry air $\left[\frac{J}{kg\cdot K}\right]$}, \nonumber\\
  R_{vapor}&= \text{specific gas constant for water $\left[\frac{J}{kg\cdot K}\right]$}, \nonumber\\
  T &= \text{ambient air temperature $\left[K\right]$}, \nonumber\\
  U &= \text{wind speed at the hub height of the turbine $\left[\frac{m}{s}\right]$}\nonumber\\
  &= v_{ref}\frac{\ln\left(\frac{z}{z_0}\right)}{\ln\left(\frac{z_{ref}}{z_0}\right)}\\
  v_{ref} &= \text{wind speed at measured height$\left[\frac{m}{s}\right]$}\nonumber\\
  z_0 &= \text{roughness length [m]}\nonumber\\
  z &= \text{hub height of the turbine [m]}\nonumber\\
  z_{ref} &= \text{height of wind speed measurement [m]}\nonumber\\
  D &= \text{wind turbine diameter [m]}\nonumber
\end{align}
After calculating theoretical wind power generation from wind speed data, the
data are passed to \gls{pygen} and used as a capacity factor. I permuted the
ten years of wind speed and solar radiation data to generate a total of 100
unique scenarios that captures the annual variability of solar and wind. The
choice to use a limited set of historical data to generate a broader set of
scenarios is justified since wind speed and \gls{ghi} are highly uncorrelated.
Figure \ref{fig:solar-wind-corr} shows a heatmap of correlations among various
weather parameters.
