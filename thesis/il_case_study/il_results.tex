This chapter presents the results of the Illinois case study. These simulations
consider the influence intra- and inter-year variability of renewable resources.
In all cases, the energy system produces zero carbon emissions by 2030,
consistent with the Illinois government's stated policy goals
\cite{harmon_climate_2021,office_of_governor_jb_pritzker_gov_2021}. The table
below is a recreation of Table \ref{tab:il-scenarios}, and describes the
scenarios used in the following experiments. In section \ref{section:time_res} I
discuss the influence of temporal complexity on model results. Section \ref{section:resource_sa}
covers the model's sensitivity to resource availability. These results inform
my analysis of the \gls{uiuc} microgrid in chapter \ref{chapter:uiuc}.

\section{Sensitivity to Time Resolution}
\label{section:time_res}

First, I examined the influence of time resolution on model results for the four
unique scenarios outlined in the table above. The table below, which is a
replication of  Table \ref{tab:time-slice}, describes the total number of time slices in each model run.
The sensitivity to time resolution reflects the sensitivity to \textit{intra-year}
variability.

  \end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{Least Cost Scenario}

The \gls{LC} scenario, shown in Figure \ref{fig:time_res_LC}, has no
technology constraints. When the model uses only 96 time slices --- the lowest
resolution simulated --- the results show that Illinois' cheapest path to net-zero
electricity uses
only solar, wind, and battery storage to replace fossil fuels. This path includes
a significant over-build of wind and solar capacity that is either stored
or curtailed. The combined penetration (the fraction of total generation)
of solar, wind, and storage, reaches almost 60\% in this model run. The installed
capacity of solar and wind are comparable. Notably, the battery storage
required to ensure grid reliability in this scenario is 14.5 GW of power with
a 4-hour duration by 2030. This battery capacity exceeds California's current
battery capacity thirtyfold \cite{hutchins_us_2021}. More battery storage is
required by 2050. The least time-resolved simulation builds the most capacity in
the \gls{LC} scenario due to the low cost of renewable energy and the apparent
predictability from the lack of temporal detail.

With an increase in time resolution, to 288 time slices, the cheapest pathway
for net-zero electricity includes some advanced nuclear capacity.
Due to the assumed high capacity factor of advanced nuclear, the penetration of
solar and wind decreases by almost half. The addition of advanced nuclear also significantly
reduces battery storage requirements. Further, wind power's share of installed renewable
capacity drops from half to a third.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{0.95\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/time_resolution_plot_LC.pgf}}
  \caption{Impact of time resolution on the least cost results. Each year has four bars where
  each bar represents a different time resolution. Left to right, the time resolutions are: 4
  seasons, 12 months, 52 weeks, 365 days.
  The left column shows the installed capacity and the right column shows the
  total generation. The top row plots the absolute numbers in either GW or TWh
  and the bottom row shows the relative penetration of each technology as a
  percentage of the total capacity or generation, respectively.}
  \label{fig:time_res_LC}
\end{figure}

Increasing the time resolution to 52 representative days (one for
each week) decreased the share of intermittent renewables and increased advanced
nuclear capacity. The percentage of renewable capacity from wind dropped to
just over a quarter of the total renewable capacity. This simulation installed
the least total capacity and doubled nuclear power capacity by 2050.
The daily resolution is somewhat different from the previous simulations
since the total capacity increases rather than decreases.
In spite of this, the relative share of renewable technology changes very little
as shown in the lower left panel of Figure \ref{fig:time_res_LC}.
This is because the reduction in wind capacity is met with an increase in solar
panels. The increased capacity comes from additions to advanced nuclear and battery
storage capacity.

The total discharge from batteries decreases with greater time resolution because
the share of generation from intermittent sources decreases concomitantly. Thus
there is less total load that needs to be shifted. The battery capacity \textit{increases}
at the highest resolution because there moments when more instantaneous power is
required. The total electricity generation decreases with greater time resolution
for the same reason --- there is less excess renewable capacity to curtail.

\subsection{Expensive Nuclear and Zero Advanced Nuclear Scenarios}
\label{section:zan_xan}

Figure \ref{fig:time_res_ZAN} and Figure \ref{fig:time_res_XAN} show the sensitivities of
\gls{XAN} and \gls{ZAN} scenarios to time resolution.
The results are identical for these two scenarios at time resolutions less a than
full year because doubling the capital cost of advanced nuclear has an effect similar
to explicitly prohibiting it in these scenarios. The results for the \gls{XAN}
scenario in Figure \ref{fig:time_res_XAN} show more technologies than in the
\gls{ZAN} scenario because the model built a negligible but non-zero amount of
capacity in the first time periods of the model. These technologies (advanced natural
gas and advanced coal) are ultimately not used due to the strict limit on carbon
emissions.

There are three noticeable trends shared by Figure \ref{fig:time_res_ZAN} and Figure
\ref{fig:time_res_XAN} for the first three time resolutions.
 First, the total capacity and generation increase as time resolution improves.
Second, the share of renewable capacity from wind decreases with improved time resolution.
Third, necessary battery storage increases significantly with a greater number of time
slices. These trends appear because higher temporal resolutions capture more
variability in solar and wind resources. Additionally, the model installed 1.5 GW
of biomass-fired power plants at a weekly resolution. Although scarcely used,
this capacity served as a back-up when renewable sources and stored energy from
batteries were insufficient.

These two scenarios diverge when simulated with a full year of hourly
resolution. The \gls{ZAN} scenario continues on the same trajectory as before:
more total capacity and less wind penetration. However, biomass plays
a significant role in providing baseload power at this fine temporal resolution.
The \gls{XAN} scenario, illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:time_res_XAN}, introduces
advanced nuclear reactor and biomass power plants, and
thus the total capacity drops significantly.  This new nuclear capacity, along
with biomass, displaces much of the renewable energy capacity.
Further, the capacity and generation from battery storage decreases
at the daily time resolution in the \gls{ZAN} scenario, and more so in the \gls{XAN}
scenario, due to the addition of firm baseload power and the reduction of wind
capacity.

The difference between these two scenarios is exclusively the policy
towards advanced nuclear technology. This difference appears slight since the coarse
time resolution simulations were identical and the two policies function as obstacles
towards developing a new nuclear fleet. However, the small difference in policies
led to significant changes in capacity expansion as the time resolution increased.
In both of these scenarios, the finest time resolution indicates a significant
role for dispatchable baseload power not present in the coarser time resolutions.
This suggests that even slight temporal aggregation, as in the weekly time resolution,
generates potentially misleading results, such as minimizing the role of baseload
power and storage.

  \label{fig:time_res_XAN}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Nuclear Phaseout Scenario}
The final scenario considered was the \gls{ZN} scenario. Advanced
nuclear is explicitly disallowed here, and the existing Illinois nuclear fleet is shut down by
2050. These constraints match the ``100\% renewable energy'' language in the 2021
\gls{ceja} bill \cite{harmon_climate_2021}. Figure \ref{fig:time_res_ZN} shows
the time-sensitivity results for this scenario.

The same three trends observed in the \gls{ZAN} scenario are repeated and
more pronounced in a total nuclear phaseout. The model dramatically overestimates
wind penetration at low time resolution and underestimates the necessary battery capacity.
Additionally, significant biomass capacity is needed to provide baseload
power in the daily time resolution.
In this scenario, the required battery capacity more than doubles from 26 GW in the
seasonal resolution to 58 GW in weekly and daily resolutions. Illinois would need 29 GW of 4-hour
storage by 2030 to preserve grid reliability without its existing nuclear plants.
That is 58 times the current storage capacity of California and more than
14 times the storage capacity of the entire United States
\cite{hutchins_us_2021}.
Biomass provides a greater amount of baseload power, 27 GW at the highest
time resolution, than in the \gls{ZAN} scenario, which built approximately 15 GW.

  and the bottom row shows the relative penetration of each technology as a

\end{figure}


\subsection{Scenario Comparisons}
This sensitivity analysis showed the strong influence of intra-year variability
and time resolution on model results. Here, I compare the scenarios in terms
of total system cost and computational cost.

Figures \ref{fig:time_res_LC}, \ref{fig:time_res_ZAN}, \ref{fig:time_res_XAN},
and \ref{fig:time_res_ZN}
show the capacities and generation of each technology in their respective scenarios.
It is important to note that the scale of each plot is different since scenarios
that allow advanced nuclear to supply firm energy require less total capacity.
This trend is discussed further in section \ref{section:resouce:sa}.
Figure \ref{fig:time_res_cost} shows the differences between total system costs
for each scenario and time resolution.
In all cases, the total system cost increases with time resolution. The \gls{LC}
scenario is appropriately named since it had the lowest total cost
of all scenarios and time resolutions. The \gls{XAN} and \gls{ZAN} scenarios share
nearly identical cost curves,
with a very slight difference in cost with 8760 time slices (daily). Since these
scenarios are so close in cost but have divergent energy futures, they could represent
alternatives in terms of other unmodeled objectives, such as social acceptance,
along with policy differences. Completely phasing out Illinois' existing nuclear
fleet leads to much higher costs in all scenarios.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{0.75\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/time_res_cost_plot.pgf}}
  \caption{Impact of time resolution on the objective function for each scenario.}
  \label{fig:time_res_cost}
\end{figure}



% \subsection{Discussion of Time Resolution}
There is a significant tradeoff between model complexity (in this case, temporal),
and computational cost. Table \ref{tab:time_res_clock} shows the
wall-clock time for each simulation, illustrating this tradeoff.
The computing time increases with both the temporal resolution and the number of
decision variables. The \gls{XAN} scenario with 8760 time slices had the most decision
variables since the model considered coal and natural gas with
carbon-capture-and-storage and therefore took the longest. The zero-advanced-nuclear
scenario was the fastest at finer time resolutions because it has the fewest
available technologies.

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \caption{Wall-clock run time for each simulation in seconds}
  \label{tab:time_res_clock}
  \begin{tabular}{l*{4}{r}}
    \toprule
    & \multicolumn{4}{c}{Number of Time Slices}\\
    Scenario & 96 & 288 & 1248&8760\\
    \midrule
    LC &13.27&50.47&481.03&18566.30\\
    XAN &10.49&41.96&373.20&29152.75\\

    ZN & 10.57&37.80&223.87&7908.50\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}


I use the daily resolution as the reference case since it captures the most
intra-year variability.
Table \ref{tab:relative_error} shows the relative difference in capacity for each
simulation with respect to the daily resolution. From Table \ref{tab:relative_error}
and Figure \ref{fig:time_res_cost}, there are two commonalities across all scenarios
and time resolutions.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The penetration of wind energy is greatly overestimated.
  \item Except when explicitly disallowed, preserving Illinois' existing nuclear
  fleet is the most cost-effective way to decarbonize Illinois' electric sector.
\end{enumerate}
In most other cases, solar power is underestimated since wind power is partially
replaced by solar, since wind capacity fell as temporal detail increased. Therefore,
the overestimate of wind power leads to an underestimate in
solar power. The exception to this is the \gls{XAN} scenario, which overestimates
solar power because the model introduces advanced nuclear at the highest time resolution.
Scenarios without advanced nuclear energy vastly underestimate the importance of
baseload power and therefore underestimate the role of biomass in those cases.
Advanced nuclear is preferred over biomass due to its higher capacity factor and
lower fuel costs, when both are available.

\section{Sensitivity to Resource Availability}
\label{section:resource_sa}

Typical \gls{esom} studies perform sensitivity analysis over cost parameters and
attempt to capture the variability of renewable energy sources using time slice
aggregation. However, even well-chosen time slices fail to capture the total variability
of wind and solar because models, like \gls{temoa}, treat each year in a model
horizon as identical \cite{hunter_modeling_2013}. In the present analysis, the
sensitivities of electricity cost and capacity expansion to renewable resource
availability are explicitly considered using a weekly resolution and a unique combination
of eleven years of solar and wind data in each model run. By doing this analysis,
we can develop a hedging strategy that avoids costly power outages and ensures
grid reliability. I used a weekly time resolution to ensure computational tractability.

Figure \ref{fig:obj_cost_plot} shows the spread of electricity cost for each scenario.
The mean price of electricity in the \gls{LC} scenario is 16 percent less than
the \gls{XAN} or \gls{ZAN} scenarios and 28 percent cheaper than the Nuclear Phaseout scenario.
Additionally, the variance is far less in the \gls{LC} scenario than the other
three scenarios. The \gls{XAN} and \gls{ZAN} scenarios are virtually identical
except for a subset of simulations at the high end of the system cost. The maximum
system cost is slightly lower for the \gls{XAN} scenario than in \gls{ZAN} because advanced
nuclear is not explicitly disallowed. The cost of electricity is most uncertain
in the \gls{ZN} scenario and the mean value is the highest of any case.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{0.95\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/obj_cost_plot.pgf}}
  \caption{Sensitivity of the levelized cost of electricity to variability of
   solar and wind resources.}
  \label{fig:obj_cost_plot}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:il_capacity} shows how resource availability affects capacity
expansion. As shown previously in Section \ref{section:time_res}, the \gls{LC} scenario
has the lowest total capacity because most of the generation comes from firm nuclear
power. The nuclear-constrained scenarios in Figure \ref{fig:il_capacity} also
highlight the necessity of on-demand back-up capacity. Biomass plants serve that role
in the \gls{ZN}, \gls{ZAN}, and \gls{XAN} scenarios. The mean biomass capacity is higher
in the \gls{ZAN} scenario than in \gls{XAN} because the latter allows advanced nuclear. Since
this sensitivity study only uses a weekly time resolution, all three nuclear-constrained
scenarios underestimate the role of baseload power compared to the daily resolution,
as shown in Table \ref{tab:relative_error}. The uncertainty in renewable energy
capacity is also much higher for these three scenarios.
The large uncertainties in system cost and capacity expansion due to resource
variability suggests significant policy challenges in planning for energy
reliability. Further, the uncertainty in renewable capacity drives the uncertainty
in system cost.


\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{0.95\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/capacity_sensitivity.pgf}}
  \caption{Sensitivity of the installed capacity to variability of
   solar and wind resources.}
  \label{fig:il_capacity}
\end{figure}

The \gls{XAN} case simulates the
\textit{expectation} of significant cost overruns for every reactor build. Even so,
with only a weekly resolution there are scenarios where building advanced reactors
is advantageous in the \gls{XAN} case. These results likely underestimate the role of
advanced nuclear since advanced nuclear showed up in the \gls{XAN} case for 8760
time slices, where it was previously not needed, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:time_res_XAN}.

\section{Discussion and Policy Implications}

The fundamental question in capacity expansion problems is: How much capacity is enough?
\glspl{esom} attempt to answer this question while balancing other priorities such
as reducing carbon emissions and ensuring grid reliability. Many studies address
deep uncertainties surrounding future costs
\cite{alzbutas_uncertainty_2012,barron_differential_2015,komiyama_energy_2015,
li_open_2020,yue_least_2020} or different energy and climate policies \cite{bennett_extending_2021,
bouckaert_expanding_2014,de_sisternes_value_2016,decarolis_modelling_2016,neumann_near-optimal_2021,
seck_embedding_2020} by evaluating a set of cases, Monte Carlo sampling cost distributions,
or using \gls{mga}. Virtually all of these studies include intermittent renewable
energy in the model, but none treat the annual variability of solar and wind
as an uncertain parameter, nor do they consider the effect of time resolution on
model results. The purpose of these analyses was to address precisely that issue
and to help inform science-based policymaking.

Figure \ref{fig:obj_cost_plot} and Figure \ref{fig:il_capacity} clarify
two points. First, including firm nuclear capacity has the greatest positive
influence on both the certainty and the mean of system levelized cost. Relying primarily
on intermittent renewables increases both the mean and uncertainty of electricity cost.
We observe a high variance in cost for these scenarios.
Second, the fundamental question of \glspl{esom} is unanswerable without firm nuclear capacity.
As the penetration of intermittent renewables increases, so does the uncertainty around
capacity expansion. This pattern likely continues at a full-year hourly time resolution
since the model underestimates total capacity in every case, except for the \gls{XAN} scenario.

I modeled biomass as an alternative firm capacity option. The mean biomass in all
nuclear-constrained scenarios is greater than 5 GW. Table \ref{tab:relative_error}
shows that this is likely an underestimate. \gls{nrel} calculated Illinois technical
potential for biomass electricity production at 4 GW, the highest of any state
\cite{lopez_us_2012}. These results indicate a greater capacity requirement than
Illinois' technical potential, suggesting that to satisfying energy needs would
require either greater renewable and storage capacity or the inclusion of advanced
nuclear reactors. Due to large uncertainties in resource availability, the renewable
capacity requirement will never be clear.

The results show that the minimum hedging strategy for decarbonizing Illinois'
electricity is preserving the existing nuclear fleet since the entire existing
nuclear capacity is present in all simulations and resolutions unless explicitly
limited. A further hedging strategy would be to lift the moratorium on new nuclear
plants in Illinois since advanced nuclear reactors are built, even when the
capital cost doubles, unless explicitly limited. Further, the \gls{LC} scenario
results in Figure \ref{fig:time_res_LC} show that solar energy is a good investment
and may couple well with advanced nuclear reactors. Further investments in wind
power should be considered carefully or eliminated altogether.

As outlined in section \ref{section:energy_policy}, good energy policies should
ensure reliability, affordability, and sustainability. The results in section
\ref{section:time_res} and section \ref{section:resource_sa} challenge the
current Illinois energy policy described in \gls{ceja}. Figure \ref{fig:compare_ceja}
compares the 2030 Illinois capacity expansion for each scenario in the present
work with the current Illinois policy from \gls{ceja}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{0.85\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/il_scenario_comparison_2030.pgf}}
  \caption{The installed carbon free electric generating capacity by 2030 in
  each modeled scenario with daily resolution and Illinois' target capacity outlined
  in \gls{ceja}. Existing natural gas and coal capacity are not shown since their
  use should be eliminated by 2030.}
  \label{fig:compare_ceja}
\end{figure}

\gls{ceja} was a tremendous step towards Illinois' clean energy goals and made
Illinois a leader on climate change. In particular, \gls{ceja} provided subsidies
for ``zero emissions facilities'' (nuclear power plants) that reversed plans to
shutter Byron and Dresden Nuclear Plants prematurely \cite{harmon_climate_2021,
brown_two_2021}. However, it is clear from Figure \ref{fig:compare_ceja} that
the specific numbers recommended in \gls{ceja} could be improved by increasing
the energy storage targets and enabling advanced nuclear projects.
In every model scenario, the total CEJA target capacity falls far short of capacity
expansion. CEJA's solar and wind capacities are comparable to those in the \gls{LC}
scenario but do not include firm capacity from advanced nuclear nor sufficient
energy storage to guarantee reliability. Further, the
renewable energy targets are far lower than in the nuclear-constrained scenarios.
The authors of \gls{ceja}'s capacity targets, the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition,
assumed that Illinois would end electricity exports, reducing electricity generation
to around 75\% of its current value and that electricity demand will remain constant
through 2030 \cite{the_accelerate_group_clean_2019}. Skeptics may therefore argue
that the present comparison is unfair since the modeled scenarios preserve Illinois
status as a net-exporter and include a 1\% annual growth in electricity demand.
However, decarbonizing every economic sector, like manufacturing and
transportation, will require
at least some amount of electrification. Even with rapid technology adoption and
energy efficiency measures, electrification of other energy sectors leads to greater
electricity demand \cite{mai_electrification_2018}. Further, ending electricity
exports will force neighboring states to build more generating capacity or use
their fossil fuel reserves more regularly, which is counterproductive to reducing
carbon emissions nationally or globally.

By minimizing the vital role of clean firm capacity, \gls{ceja} cannot guarantee
reliable electricity and simultaneously enforce a carbon-free electric grid. Related to grid
reliability, higher penetrations of solar and wind, without sufficient energy
storage, leads to greater price volatility \cite{winkler_impact_2016, blazquez_renewable_2018}
and more energy poverty \cite{henry_how_2021}. The results shown in Figure
\ref{fig:obj_cost_plot} indicate that even with sufficient energy storage, the cost
of electricity is still highly uncertain. Since
\gls{ceja} cannot guarantee reliability or affordability with its current capacity
targets, Illinois may be forced to use fossil fuels as energy back-up if these
policies are pursued and implemented. Without
clean firm capacity options or sufficient energy storage, \gls{ceja} locks in
fossil fuel dependence and misses the sustainability criterion for a good energy policy.
Although the \gls{ceja}'s passage into law is an encouraging indicator of Illinois
legislators' commitment to climate action, Illinois energy and climate policies
may be improved by robust modeling efforts. Future
policies in Illinois should lift the moratorium on new nuclear facilities and
continue subsidizing these ``zero emissions facilities'' as suggested by Figure
\ref{fig:time_res_LC}, which shows the reliability benefits of advanced nuclear
projects, and Figure \ref{fig:obj_cost_plot}, which shows that scenarios with
more firm capacity also have more certain electricity costs.

\section{Limitations to the Model}

There are several limitations to the model used in this analysis. Some are related
to model assumptions and others to model structure. In this section I outline some
of these limitations and propose some solutions for future work.

First, the sensitivity analysis in Section \ref{section:resource_sa} only aggregated
time series with averaging. I chose this method due to its simplicity. Kotzur
et al. 2018 found that averaging produced the most error with respect to a
reference case with a full year of
hourly data \cite{kotzur_impact_2018}. Selecting time slices using another algorithm,
such as k-means, significantly reduced error. However, Kotzur et al. only tested a single
year of data rather than conducting a sensitivity analysis over several combinations
of historical solar and wind data as in section
\ref{section:resource_sa}. All aggregation methods are subject to error. Choosing
a simple time series aggregation approach may be forgiven in this case since section
\ref{section:time_res} includes a reference case (daily resolution) to compare against
in order to give a sense of temporal dimensionality reduction's influence on model
results. Superior temporal aggregation methods are necessary for models with enough
spatial and topological complexity that a fully time-resolved reference case is
computationally intractable.

Second, the model has no spatial resolution, effectively treating Illinois as a
climatically homogenous region. \gls{temoa} includes functionality for regional
analysis, but there is no simple way to integrate spatial data, such
as data from Geographical Information Systems (GIS) \cite{martinez-gordon_review_2021}.
Like temporal aggregation, spatial aggregation is often the default approach in
\gls{esom} studies due to modelers' preferences for topological complexity and
technology options \cite{martinez-gordon_review_2021,poncelet_impact_2016}. Spatial
aggregation leads to the loss of suitable sites for wind and solar energy that could
reduce the impact of their intermittency \cite{fleischer_minimising_2020}. However,
no studies have compared the conflicting influences of spatial and temporal complexity.

Due to the lack of spatial resolution, the cost of additional transmission lines
is not modeled. This is somewhat less important for scenarios with significant
baseload capacity from advanced nuclear reactors or biomass since those technologies
could be sited at retired coal or natural gas plants, as is proposed by TerraPower
in Wyoming \cite{associated_press_bill_2021}. In the case of solar panels, programs
like Solar For All and Illinois Shines \cite{chicago_illinois_nodate, noauthor_illinois_nodate}
could put all of the solar capacity on consumers' rooftops \cite{lopez_us_2012},
eliminating the need for additional transmission if they are all grid-connected.

Third, this model uses a planning reserve margin to ensure sufficient
excess capacity to guarantee grid reliability. However, this measure of reliability
may not be sufficient for grids that depend heavily on intermittent and variable
sources of electricity. Two systems with identical \glspl{prm} may not be equally
reliable. I used the FERC-recommended \gls{prm} of 15 percent, which may be
an underestimate for grids with high renewable penetration \cite{milligan_methods_2011}.
Further, because \gls{temoa} always builds enough capacity to satisfy the demand
constraint at all time slices, the model does not consider the cost of
importing electricity when there is insufficient in-state generation. However,
this issue is insignificant for Illinois simulations is a net exporter of electricity
\cite{energy_information_administration_eia_nodate}. Work that expands models beyond
the State of Illinois may need to account for this.

Lastly, the model has limited technology options. The dearth of options for
firm capacity reflects genuine physical limitations, as discussed in section
\ref{section:alt_firm}. However, other energy storage options such as
molten salt, flywheels, and hydrogen storage are less technically mature
than lithium-ion batteries but could play a role in the future. These technologies
are not necessarily difficult to model with \glspl{esom} but the lack of quality
cost estimates, such as with \gls{nrel}'s ATB, challenges the quality of subsequent
results that include these technologies.
