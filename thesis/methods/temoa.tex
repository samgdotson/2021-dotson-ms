\gls{temoa} is an open-source \gls{esom} developed at North Carolina State University.
Like other \glspl{esom}, \gls{temoa} uses linear programming to solve the optimal
least-cost solution while meeting various demand and capacity constraints \cite{hunter_modeling_2013}.
The key benefits of \gls{temoa} are its open-source code, open data, and built-in
uncertainty analysis capabilities. These features address the need for greater
transparency in \gls{esom} modeling and robust assessment of future uncertainties
\cite{hunter_modeling_2013}. One of the critical limitations of \glspl{esom} is that
the nature of the systems they are intended to model make them inherently
unverifiable. By making the data and source code open,
\gls{temoa} facilitates repeatability and its transparency provides evidence for
model integrity
\cite{decarolis_case_2012}. To that end, along with open-source code and open data,
\gls{temoa} models should be solvable
with open-source linear programming solvers like \texttt{COIN-OR} \cite{noauthor_coin-or_nodate} or \texttt{GLPK} \cite{noauthor_glpk_nodate}. I used the common
\texttt{CBC} solver from \texttt{COIN-OR} \cite{noauthor_cbc_2021} in this thesis.
Another benefit of \gls{temoa} is its flexibility.
The tool is technology agnostic and is designed to model flows and transformations
of commodities created by users.
User-defined time slices allow modelers to run a model at an arbitrarily high
time resolution, restricted only by data availability and computational resources.

\subsection{Mathematics of Temoa}
\glspl{esom} like \gls{temoa} use linear programming to optimize an objective
function, in most cases the objective function represents total system cost.
A single \gls{temoa} run minimizes the following objective function \cite{noauthor_preface_nodate},

\begin{align}
  C_{total} &= C_{loans} + C_{fixed} + C_{variable}
  \intertext{where}
  C_{loans} &= \text{the sum of all investment loan costs},\nonumber\\
  C_{fixed} &= \text{the sum of all fixed operating costs},\nonumber\\
  C_{variable} &= \text{the sum of all variable operating costs}.\nonumber
\end{align}
Each term in $C_{total}$ has a mathematical expression but the most complicated
of these terms is $C_{loans}$, which is calculated by,
\begin{align}
  C_{loans} &= \sum_{t,v \in \Theta_{IC}}{\left(\left[IC_{t,v}\cdot LA_{t,v} \cdot \frac{(1+GDR)^{P_0-v+1}\cdot (1-(1+GDR)^{-LLN_{t,v}})}{GDR} \cdot \frac{1-(1+GDR)^{-LPA_{t,v}}}{1-(1+GDR)^{-LP_{t,v}}}\right] \cdot \textbf{CAP}_{t,v}\right)}
  \intertext{where}
  t &= \text{the name index of a particular technology}, \nonumber\\
  v &= \text{the vintage (i.e. construction year) of a particular technology}, \nonumber\\
  \Theta_{IC} &= \text{the set of all technologies that have associated investment costs}, \nonumber\\
  IC_{t,v} &= \text{the investment cost for a particular technology and vintage (i.e. a ``process'')},\nonumber\\
  LA_{t,v} &= \text{the amortization of the loan},\nonumber\\
  \displaybreak
  &= \frac{DR_{t,v}}{1-(1+DR_{t,v})^{-LLN_{t,v}}} \forall \{t,v\} \in \Theta_{IC}\\
  DR_{t,v} &= \text{the process specific discount rate}, \nonumber\\
  GDR &= \text{the global discount rate, applied to all processes}, \nonumber\\
  P_0 &= \text{the first year in the simulation}, \nonumber\\
  P_{last} &= \text{the last year in the simulation}, \nonumber\\
  LLN_{t,v} &= \text{the loan lifetime of a process}, \nonumber\\
  LP_{t,v} &= \text{the total lifetime of a process}, \nonumber\\
  LPA_{t,v} &= \text{the active lifetime of a process}, \nonumber\\
  &= \min{\left(LP_{t,v}, \left(P_{last}-LP_{t,v}\right)\right)}\\
  \textbf{CAP}_{t,v} &= \text{the capacity of a process}.\nonumber
\end{align}
An essential point in this formulation is that the loan period, $LLN_{t,v}$ only
influences the value of the objective function when the global discount rate
and the process-specific discount rate take on unique values. The difference between
these two values is known as the ``hurdle rate.'' When the hurdle rate is zero,
$C_{loans}$ is not a function of the loan period. I
do not specify unique discount rates for each process in the following case studies.
Some work suggests that a high discount rate may encourage capital-intensive projects \cite{alzbutas_uncertainty_2012,
decarolis_modelling_2016}, but the effect of hurdle rates is beyond the scope of
this thesis. This objective function is also subject to various constraints that
guarantee energy demands are met at all times and, if specified, ensures respect
of capacity and emissions limits. The details of these constraints and the
mathematical expressions for the other cost terms are available online
\cite{noauthor_preface_nodate}.

\subsubsection{Modeling-to-Generate-Alternatives}
\gls{mga} enables systematic evaluation of structural uncertainty by probing
near-optimal decision space. \gls{temoa} uses the Hop-Skip-Jump (HSJ) algorithm for
\gls{mga}. The steps for HSJ are \cite{decarolis_modelling_2016}:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item obtain an optimal solution by any method,
  \item add a user-specified amount of slack to the objective function value from the
  first step,
  \item use the adjusted objective function value as an upper bound constraint,
  \item generate a new objective function that minimizes the sum of all decision
  variables,
  \item iterate the procedure,
  \item stop the \gls{mga} when no significant changes are observed.
\end{enumerate}
The mathematical formulation of this algorithm is:
\begin{align}
  \intertext{Minimize:}
  p &= \sum_{k\in K} x_k,
  \intertext{Subject to:}
  f_j\left(\vec{x}\right) &\leq T_j \forall j,\\
  \vec{x}&\in X,
  \intertext{where}
  p &= \text{the new objective function}\nonumber,\\
  \displaybreak
  x_k &= \text{the $k^{th}$ decision variable with a nonzero value in previous solutions}\nonumber,\\
  f_j\left(\vec{x}\right) &= \text{the $j^{th}$ original objective function},\nonumber\\
  T_j &= \text{the slack-adjusted target value},\nonumber\\
  X &= \text{the set of all feasible solutions}.\nonumber
\end{align}
This procedure results in a small set of maximally different solutions for
modelers to interpret. In this way, \gls{mga} efficiently explores decision space
to offer alternatives that may capture unmodeled objectives, such as political
expediency or social acceptance.

\subsection{Na\"{i}ve Pathway to 100\% Clean Energy: Linear Programming Example}
\label{section:naive-example}

In this subsection, I present the results of a simple example model.
This example illustrates the influence of both structural and parametric uncertainties
and how \gls{mga} probes decision space. I include this example to give an intuition
for the results in presented in Chapter \ref{chapter:illinois} and Chapter
\ref{chapter:uiuc}. This example also motivates the need for \gls{esom} modeling
when developing science-driven policy. As discussed in Section \ref{section:ceja},
the \gls{ceja} bill promises to make Illinois' electric grid 100\% clean energy
by 2030. According to the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition, 6.3 GW of additional wind energy
capacity and 17 GW of solar capacity should be enough to achieve this goal while
meeting Illinois' electricity demand \cite{the_accelerate_group_clean_2019}. The
Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition implicitly assumes the following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item all of Illinois' existing nuclear fleet will be operating in 2030,
  \item all fossil fuel plants will be replaced by wind or solar energy in 2030,
  \item stagnant electricity demand,
  \item zero electricity exports. Illinois currently exports approximately 24\%
  of its total generation \cite{energy_information_administration_eia_nodate}.
\end{enumerate}
In 2019, the electricity demand of Illinois was 138 TWh, and 98.7 TWh generated from
nuclear power \cite{energy_information_administration_eia_nodate}.
Formulated as a linear programming problem, Illinois must:
\begin{align}
  \intertext{Minimize:}
  C_{total} &= C_s x_s + C_w x_w
  \intertext{Subject to:}
  D &\leq \left[CF_s x_s + CF_w x_w\right]\cdot8.76
  \intertext{where}
  x_s &= \text{capacity of solar (first decision variable), $\left[GW\right]$}\nonumber\\
  x_w &= \text{capacity of wind (first decision variable), $\left[GW\right]$}\nonumber\\
  C_s &= \text{cost of solar, $\left[\frac{B\$}{GW}\right]$} \nonumber\\
  C_w &= \text{cost of wind, $\left[\frac{B\$}{GW}\right]$}\nonumber\\
  CF_s &= \text{capacity factor of solar,  $\left[\%\right]$}  \nonumber\\
  CF_w &= \text{capacity factor of wind, $\left[\%\right]$}  \nonumber\\
  D &= \text{remaining electricity demand, $\left[TWh\right]$}\nonumber\\
  8.76 &= \text{a factor that converts power in GW to energy in TWh}\nonumber.
\end{align}
The capacity factor (CF)
is the ratio of energy produced by a generating technology and the energy it could
have produced if it operated 100\% of the time. CF is given by,
\begin{align}
  CF &= \frac{E_{tot}}{P_{np}*8.76}
  \intertext{where}
  E_{tot} &= \text{the total energy produced in a given year, $\left[TWh\right]$} \nonumber\\
  P_{np} &= \text{the nameplate capacity of a generator, $\left[GW\right]$}\nonumber.
\end{align}

Table \ref{tab:naive} summarizes the data for this toy problem.

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \caption{Summary of Solar and Wind Data for the ``Na\"{i}ve Pathway"}
  \label{tab:naive}
  \resizebox{0.75\textwidth}{!}{
  \input{methods/naive_ceja}
  }
\end{table}

This linear problem only has two decision variables, solar and wind capacity,
which makes it graphically solvable. Figure \ref{fig:mga-fig} shows the optimal
solution and one \gls{mga} iteration to illustrate the changes to decision space.
I plot the \gls{ceja} goals for reference.
Every point above the demand constraint (the dotted blue line) represents a
feasible solution since those
combinations of solar and wind can meet annual electricity demand.
Points above the ``demand constraint'' line, represent an excess of total capacity.
The \gls{ceja} goals are well within the feasible region but highly sub-optimal;
building excess capacity.
This amount of capacity suggests the energy could be exported, curtailed, or stored,
which are unmodeled, structural uncertainties, in this formulation.
The optimal solution minimizes the total cost and lies at the intersection
of the objective function and the demand constraint. The objective function cannot
be reduced further because those solutions would not satisfy the electricity demand.
The \gls{mga} ``objective function'' added a 10\% slack to the original objective
function and became an additional upper bound constraint. The new objective function
minimizes the sum of solar and wind capacity. In this trivial case, the model will
always build solar over wind unless the cost of wind becomes cheaper than the cost of
solar. However, the example illustrates \gls{mga} generally. Finally, although \gls{mga}
scenarios may account for either structural or parametric uncertainties
\cite{decarolis_modelling_2016}, I use the former interpretation because
\gls{mga} cannot specify which uncertain parameters led to a particular scenario.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{0.8\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/naive_mga.pgf}}
  \caption{The optimal solution lies at the intersection between the objective
  function (orange line) and the demand constraint (dashed blue line). An MGA
  iteration is shown by adding a 10\% slack to the objective function (black line).
  The red dot shows the \gls{ceja} goals for renewable energy, for reference.}
  \label{fig:mga-fig}
\end{figure}

While \gls{mga} helps modelers explore alternative energy futures and structural
uncertainty, quantifying parametric uncertainty is essential for creating robust insights
for policy decisions. Figure \ref{fig:param-fig} shows the same decision space for
the na\"{i}ve capacity expansion problem as before with upper and lower bounds for
the demand constraint and objective function, with 10\% uncertainty applied to all
parameters. The upper bound for the demand constraint, illustrated in blue,
represents a scenario where
the capacity factors for wind and solar are both 10\% less than average, and electricity
demand is 10\% higher. The upper and lower bounds on the objective function, in red,
represent futures where solar and wind energy costs are 10\% higher or lower,
respectively. The red dot in Figure \ref{fig:param-fig} represents the
capacity goal set by CEJA. There are several methods to explore this optimal space and
\gls{temoa} has some functionality for two: \gls{mca} \cite{yue_review_2018} and
stochastic optimization \cite{decarolis_multi-stage_2012, bennett_extending_2021}.
\gls{mca} is useful for global sensitivity analysis since its computational
cost increases with the number of iterations but not the number of uncertain
parameters. However, \gls{mca} depends strongly on the underlying data distribution
and cannot give a probability for any given scenario \cite{yue_review_2018}.
Stochastic optimization offers a likelihood and a possible ``hedging'' strategy,
but computational cost limits the number of uncertain parameters that can be
tested \cite{yue_review_2018}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{0.8\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/naive_parametric.pgf}}
  \caption{Decision space for the na\"{i}ve capacity expansion problem with
  10\% uncertainty applied to all parameters. The optimal space lies within
  overlapping blue and red regions. The red dot shows the \gls{ceja} goals for
  renewable energy, for reference.}
  \label{fig:param-fig}
\end{figure}

This example illustrates the \gls{mga} method and shows how the optimal space
expands under parametric uncertainties.
Although a useful demonstration, considering the optimal mixture of wind and solar
to achieve Illinois' clean energy goals in this manner and comparing it to
current policy oversimplifies the problem.
Many features of energy systems are not captured in this simple formulation,
such as the availability of solar power, need for backup or energy storage when
the weather fails, and other clean technology options. Thus \glspl{esom} are necessary.

In the following case studies, I apply \gls{mga} to explore near-optimal solutions
for the \gls{uiuc} energy system (Chapter \ref{chapter:uiuc}) and study the
sensitivity of Illinois' grid to wind and solar capacity factor profiles and time
resolution (Chapter \ref{chapter:illinois}).
