This chapter presents the results of the Illinois case study. In all cases, the
energy system produces zero carbon emissions by 2030, consistent with the Illinois
government's stated policy goals
\cite{harmon_climate_2021,office_of_governor_jb_pritzker_gov_2021}.
\section{Sensitivity to Time Resolution}
\label{section:time_res}

First, I examined the influence of time resolution on model results for four
unique scenarios. The total number of time-slices in each model run is
described in Table \ref{tab:time-slices}.

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \caption{Summary of Time-slices}
  \label{tab:time-slices}
  \begin{tabular}{lrrr}
    \toprule
    Title & Hours & Seasons & Time-slices \\
    \midrule
    Seasonal & 24 & 4 & 96\\
    Monthly & 24 & 12 & 288\\
    Weekly & 24 & 52 & 1248\\
    Daily & 24 & 365 & 8760\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
The sensitivity to time resolution reflects the sensitivity to \textit{intra-year}
variability.

\subsection{Least Cost Scenario}

In the ``Least Cost'' scenario, shown in Figure \ref{fig:time_res_LC},
there are no technology constraints. When the model uses only 96 time-slices,
the results show that cheapest path to net-zero electricity in Illinois uses
only solar, wind, and battery storage to replace fossil fuels. This includes
a significant over-build of wind and solar capacity that is either stored
or curtailed. The combined penetration (the fraction of total generation)
of solar, wind, and storage, reaches almost 60\% in this model run. The installed
capacity of solar and wind are comparable. Importantly, the battery storage
required to ensure grid reliability in this scenario is 14.5 GW of power with
a 4-hour duration by 2030. This battery capacity exceeds California's current
battery capacity thirty fold \cite{hutchins_us_2021}.

With a slightly improved time resolution, 288 time slices, the cheapest pathway
for net-zero electricity includes a modest addition of advanced nuclear capacity.
Due to the assumed high capacity factor of advanced nuclear, the penetration of
solar and wind is roughly halved. The addition of advanced nuclear also significantly
reduces battery storage requirements. Further, the share of installed renewable
capacity from wind drops from half to a third.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{0.95\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/time_resolution_plot_LC.pgf}}
  \caption{Impact of time resolution on the least cost results. Each year has four bars where
  each bar represents a different time resolution. Left to right, the time resolutions are: 4
  seasons, 12 months, 52 weeks, 365 days.}
  \label{fig:time_res_LC}
\end{figure}

Increasing the time resolution to 52 representative days (one for
each week) decreased the share of intermittent renewables an increased advanced
nuclear capacity. The share of renewable capacity from wind dropped to
just over a quarter of the total renewable capacity. This simulation installed
the least total capacity and doubled the capacity of nuclear power by 2050.
The daily resolution is somewhat different since the total capacity increases,
however the relative share of renewable technology changes very little. This is
because the reduction in wind capacity is met with a large increase in solar
panels.

The total discharge from batteries decreases with greater time resolution because
the share of generation from intermittent sources decreases concomitantly. Thus
there is less total load that needs to be shifted. The battery capacity \textit{increases}
at the highest resolution because there moments when more instantaneous capacity is
needed.

\subsection{Expensive Nuclear and Zero Advanced Nuclear Scenarios}

The sensitivities of ``Expensive Nuclear'' and ``Zero Advanced Nuclear'' scenarios
to time resolution are shown in Figure \ref{fig:time_res_ZAN} and \ref{fig:time_res_XN}.
The results are identical for these two scenarios at time resolutions less than
365 days because doubling the capital cost of advanced nuclear has an effect simiar
to explicitly prohibiting it, in these scenarios.
There are three noticable trends shared by Figure \ref{fig:time_res_ZAN} and Figure
\ref{fig:time_res_XN} for the first three time resolutions.
 First, the total capacity and generation increase as time resolution improves.
Second, the share of renewable capacity from wind decreases with improved time resolution.
Third, necessary battery storage increases significantly with a greater number of time-
slices. These trends appear because higher temporal resolutions capture more
variability in solar and wind resources. Additionally, at a weekly resolution, the
model installed 1.5 GW of biomass fired power plants. Although scarcely used,
this capacity served as a back-up when renewable sources and stored energy are
insufficient.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{0.95\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/time_resolution_plot_ZAN.pgf}}
  \caption{Impact of time resolution on the zero advanced nuclear scenario.
  Each year has four bars where each bar represents a different time resolution.
  Left to right, the time resolutions are: 4 seasons, 12 months, 52 weeks, 365 days.}
  \label{fig:time_res_ZAN}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{0.95\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/time_resolution_plot_XN.pgf}}
  \caption{Impact of time resolution on the expensive nuclear scenario.
  Each year has four bars where each bar represents a different time resolution.
  Left to right, the time resolutions are: 4 seasons, 12 months, 52 weeks, 365 days.}
  \label{fig:time_res_XN}
\end{figure}

These two scenarios diverge dramatically when simulated with a full year of hourly
resolution. The ZAN scenario continues on the same trajectory as before: more total capacity
and less wind penetration. However, at this fine temporal resolution biomass plays
a significant role providing baseload power. In the XN scenario, the total capacity
drops significantly since an advanced nuclear reactor and biomass power plants are
introduced. This new nuclear capacity, along with biomass, displaces much of the
renewable energy capacity.

\subsection{Nuclear Phaseout Scenario}
The final scenario considered was the ``Nuclear Phaseout'' scenario. Here, advanced
nuclear is explicitly disallowed and the existing Illinois nuclear fleet is shut down by
2050. This matches the ``100\% renewable energy'' language in the 2021 \gls{ceja} bill
\cite{harmon_climate_2021}. Figure \ref{fig:time_res_ZN} shows the time sensitivity
results for this scenario.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{0.95\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/time_resolution_plot_ZN.pgf}}
  \caption{Impact of time resolution on the nuclear phaseout scenario.  Each
  year has four bars where each bar represents a different time resolution.
  Left to right, the time resolutions are: 4 seasons, 12 months, 52 weeks, 365 days.}
  \label{fig:time_res_ZN}
\end{figure}

The same three trends observed in the ZAN scenario are repeated, and
more pronounced, in a total nuclear phaseout. Wind penetration is greatly overestimated
with low time resolution and the necessary battery capacity is greatly underestimated.
Additionally, there is significant biomass capacity needed to provide baseload
power in the daily time resolution.
In this scenario, the required battery capacity more than doubles from 26 GW in the
seasonal resolution to 58 GW in weekly and daily resolutions. Illinois would need 29 GW of 4-hour
storage by 2030 to preserve grid reliability without its existing nuclear plants.
That's 58 times the existing storage capacity of California, and more than
14 times the storage capacity of the entire United States
\cite{hutchins_us_2021}.


\subsection{Discussion of Time Resolution}
This sensitivity analysis showed the strong influence of intra-year variability
and time resolution on model results.Table \ref{tab:time_res_clock} shows the
wall-clock time for each simulation, illustrating tradeoff between model
complexity and computational cost.

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \caption{Wall-clock run time for each simulation in seconds}
  \label{tab:time_res_clock}
  \begin{tabular}{l*{4}{r}}
    \toprule
    & \multicolumn{4}{c}{Number of Time Slices}\\
    Scenario & 96 & 288 & 1248&8760\\
    \midrule
    LC &13.27&50.47&481.03&18566.30\\
    XAN &10.49&41.96&373.20&29152.75\\
    ZAN &9.87&36.69&280.86&9963.13\\
    ZN & 10.57&37.80&223.87&7908.50\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The computing time increases with both the temporal resolution and the number of
decision variables. The XAN scenario with 8760 time-slices had the most decision
variables, since coal and natural gas with CCS were considered, and therefore took
the longest.

If we consider the 52-week resolution the ``truth,'' then Table \ref{tab:relative_error}
shows the relative error for the less resolved simulations. In the nuclear constrained
scenarios, 288 time slices generally results in less than 10 percent error. In the
LC case, even a monthly resolution fails to achieve a reasonable error. In all cases,
96 time slices is clearly inadequate and often exceeds 50 percent error.

\section{Sensitivity to Resource Availability}

Typical \gls{esom} studies perform sensitivity analysis over cost parameters and
attempt to capture the variability of renewable energy sources using time-slice
aggregation. However, even well chosen time-slices fail to capture the full variability
of wind and solar because models, like \gls{temoa}, treat each year in a model
horizon as identical \cite{hunter_modeling_2013}. In the present analysis, the
sensitivities of electricity cost and capacity expansion to renewable resource
availability are explicitly considered using a weekly resolution and a unique combination
of solar and wind data in each model run. By doing this analysis we can develop
a hedging strategy that avoids costly power outages and ensures grid reliability.

Figure \ref{fig:obj_cost_plot} shows the spread of electricity cost for each scenario.
The mean price of electricity in the Least Cost scenario is 16 percent less than
the XAN or ZAN scenarios and 28 percent cheaper than the Nuclear Phaseout scenario.
Additionally, the variance is greatly reduced in the Least Cost scenario compared
with the other three scenarios. The XAN and ZAN scenarios are virtually identical
except for a subset of simulations at the high end of system cost. The maximum
system cost is slightly lower for the XAN scenario than in ZAN because advanced
nuclear is not explicitly disallowed.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{0.95\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/obj_cost_plot.pgf}}
  \caption{Sensitivity of the levelized cost of electricity to variability of
   solar and wind resources.}
  \label{fig:obj_cost_plot}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:il_capacity} shows how resource availability affects capacity
expansion. As shown previously in Section \ref{section:time_res}, the LC scenario
has the lowest total capacity because most of the generation come from firm nuclear
power. The nuclear constrained scenarios in Figure \ref{fig:il_capacity} also
highlight the necessity of on-demand back up capacity. In the ZN, ZAN, and XAN
scenarios, biomass plants serve that role. The uncertainty in renewable energy
capacity is much higher for each of these scenarios.  The XAN case simulates the
\textit{expectation} of significant cost overruns for every reactor build. So,
somewhat surprisingly, there are scenarios in the XAN case where building
advanced reactors is advantageous.

\end{figure}

\section{Sensitivity Analysis Discussion}

The fundamental question in capacity expansion problems is: How much capacity is enough?
\glspl{esom} attempt to answer this question while balancing other priorities such
as reducing carbon emissions and ensuring grid reliability. Many studies address
deep uncertainties surrounding future costs
\cite{alzbutas_uncertainty_2012,barron_differential_2015,komiyama_energy_2015,
li_open_2020,yue_least_2020} or different energy and climate policies \cite{bennett_extending_2021,
bouckaert_expanding_2014,de_sisternes_value_2016,decarolis_modelling_2016,neumann_near-optimal_2021,
seck_embedding_2020} by evaluating a set of cases, Monte Carlo sampling cost distributions,
or using \gls{mga}. Virtually all of these studies include intermittent renewable
energy in the model, but none of them treat annual variability of solar and wind
as an uncertain parameter. The purpose of this analysis was to address precisely
that issue.

Figure \ref{fig:obj_cost_plot} and Figure \ref{fig:il_capacity} clarify
two points. First, that including firm nuclear capacity has the greatest positive
influence on both the certainty and the mean of system levelized cost. Relying primarily
on intermittent renewables increases both the mean and uncertainty of electricity cost.
Second, the fundamental question of \glspl{esom} is unanswerable without firm nuclear capacity.
Biomass was modeled as an alternative firm capacity option but was only marginally
useful. The renewable capacity requirement will never be clear until after that capacity
was needed.

\section{Limitations to the Model}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Lack of spatial resolution
  \item Only one temporal aggregation method was considered (averaging)
  \item Limited technology options. For example, other storage options
  could be considered.
  \item Loss of load probability needed to assess planning reserve margin.
  \item Does not consider the cost of importing electricity when there is insufficient
  state domestic generation.
  \item Costs of additional transmission lines are not modeled. This is somewhat less important
  for scenarios that build biomass and nuclear plants since those technologies could
  be sited at retired coal and natural gas plants. CITATION NEEDED. In the case of
  solar panels, programs like Solar4All could put all of the solar capacity on
  consumers rooftops eliminating the need for additional transmission if they're all
  grid connected.
\end{enumerate}
