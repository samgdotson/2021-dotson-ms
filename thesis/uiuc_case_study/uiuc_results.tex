The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign pledged to achieve net-zero carbon
emissions from all campus sectors by 2050
\cite{institute_for_sustainability_energy_and_environment_illinois_2015}. This
chapter presents the results of the \gls{uiuc} case study. Since section
\ref{section:time_res} established the importance of time resolution in model results,
accordingly all simulations in this chapter use a 52-week time resolution to ensure
computational tractability. The sensitivity analysis explores other feasible options
for the university with \gls{mga} and varies the \gls{mga} slack variable.

\section{Least Cost Pathway to Net-Zero}
This section presents the lowest cost pathway to achieving \gls{uiuc}'s carbon
neutrality goal.
Figure \ref{fig:uiuc_elc_cap} shows the annual capacity expansion in the cost
minimized solution. Notably, the capacity for all electric generating technologies
grows throughout the model horizon. In particular, the \texttt{ABBOTT\_TB} capacity
increases to just over 100 MW$_e$, even though Figure \ref{fig:uiuc_elc_gen}
shows its electric generation dropping to zero by 2050. This behavior is likely due to
the model using \texttt{ABBOTT\_TB} to meet the planning reserve margin, even
though it does not generate electricity. Additionally, electric import capacity,
\texttt{IMP\_ELC}, rises
to almost 120 MW and accounts for roughly 35\% of total electricity by 2050.
This result is consistent with the recommendation from the Campus Master Plan
\cite{affiliated_engineers_inc_utilities_2015} which recommends increased
electricity imports.

  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Lastly, the wind capacity immediately jumps to 100 MW by 2025. The model was
constrained to 100.5 MW because \gls{uiuc} has a power purchase agreement with
Rail Splitter Wind Farm, for 8\% of its output, which has an existing capacity of
100.5 MW  \cite{breitweiser_wind_2016}. The model recommends 100 MW of wind
capacity because wind energy is cheap and has significant built-in flexibility
through other electricity imports.

Figure \ref{fig:uiuc_thm_cap} and Figure \ref{fig:uiuc_chw_cap} show the capacities
for steam production and refrigeration, respectively. There is no carbon-free
alternative to produce steam besides a nuclear reactor using the technologies
in this model. Figure
\ref{fig:uiuc_chw_cap} shows that chilled water capacity increases with annual
cooling demand, and the chilled water storage is roughly constant.

\section{Alternative Pathways}

Typical formulations of capacity expansion problems use linear programming to optimize
an objective function, usually system cost. However, these models often miss
other appealing options due to unmodeled, structural uncertainty. \gls{mga}
works around this by relaxing the objective function according to a user-defined
slack variable and searching for near-optimal solutions in decision-space. This
section presents the results for \gls{uiuc} using \gls{mga} to explore alternative
pathways to net-zero carbon emissions.

Figure \ref{fig:uiuc_elc_mga} shows the \gls{mga} results for \gls{uiuc}'s electric
sector. The first panel of Figure \ref{fig:uiuc_elc_mga} shows that a one percent
increase in system cost allows \gls{uiuc} to retire Abbott Power Plant's
natural gas turbines fully and does not require nuclear-powered steam turbines
in exchange for slightly higher solar capacity and electricity imports. All other
\gls{mga} and slack values have identical results for the electric sector.
This lack of unique alternatives is possibly the result of the capacity constraints on
wind and solar and the limited set of technology options.

\begin{figure}[H]

  \resizebox{0.95\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/uiuc_elc_plot.pgf}}
  \caption{Results for capacity expansion under various slack values using modeling-
  to-generate alternatives. The x-axis ticks represent a different \gls{mga} run.
  The label indicates the run number and the value of the slack variable. For example,
  ``mga-1-1\%'' indicates the first \gls{mga} run with a one percent
  slack value. For reference, the cost minimized solution ``mga-0-x\%,'' is also
  plotted.}
  \label{fig:uiuc_elc_mga}
\end{figure}

I set the capacity limit for solar to 191 MW of photovoltaic cells, which corresponds
roughly to one-eighth of University-owned land. The fact that installed solar capacity
is so far below this limit suggests that further increases in solar capacity would
raise system costs beyond 20\% of the optimal solution.

Figure \ref{fig:uiuc_thm_mga} shows the \gls{mga} results for the steam sector
of \gls{uiuc}. Similar to the electric sector, these results change very little.
Allowing the system cost to increase by 1\% allows \gls{uiuc} to build additional
natural gas capacity, which is antithetical to the goal of net-zero carbon emissions.
The nuclear capacity does not change at all. These two features are also caused
by a lack of technology options in the steam sector. As discussed in section
\ref{section:alt_firm}, there are no actual steam production alternatives to coal
and natural gas besides nuclear power in Illinois.

  slack value. For reference, the cost minimized solution ``mga-0-x\%,'' is also
  plotted.}
  \label{fig:uiuc_thm_mga}
\end{figure}

Finally, Figure \ref{fig:uiuc_chw_mga} shows the \gls{mga} runs for the chilled
water sector. As with the other two sectors, the chilled water sector lacks a
diverse set of technology options, leading to persistent results. However,
unique to this sector, the slack value changes the results. Increasing the slack
value shows a tradeoff between chilled water storage and electric chilling capacity.
The chilled water storage only decreases with slack value, indicating an
essential role for storage capacity.

\section{Discussion and Limitations}
The cheapest pathway to net-zero for \gls{uiuc} identified in this analysis has two key features:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Expanding electricity imports.
\item Replacing natural gas and coal with nuclear power.
\end{enumerate}
A significant limitation to the modeling of UIUCâ€™s electricity system is that energy
from wind power \glspl{ppa} must flow through the same infrastructure as generalized
electricity imports. In this case, the results show an increase in electricity
imports up to 220 MW. If the wind capacity does not represent a greater investment
in \glspl{ppa}, then the wind capacity must be interpreted as owned and operated
by \gls{uiuc} on its land, which would require the use of 50\% of the University's
farmland \cite{lopez_us_2012}. The former interpretation challenges \gls{uiuc}'s
energy security and independence, the primary motivation for establishing a microgrid.
The latter interpretation preserves \gls{uiuc}'s' energy independence but may restrict
its agricultural research capabilities. As a land grant university, this may
pose challenges politically.

Another limitation of this model is that it assumes the larger Illinois grid will
achieve carbon neutrality by 2030, the current state policy. If Illinois fails to
achieve this goal by 2050, UIUC would have to eliminate electricity imports entirely.
This case is not considered in the present analysis but would force the university
to produce more of its own clean electricity through nuclear, solar, or wind power.

Separately, the nuclear capacity is nearly 100 MW$_{th}$ by 2050 in all simulations.
The reactor type is not specified, although it is assumed this would be a series
of microreactors or small modular reactors. \gls{uiuc} is already pursuing a pilot
program to build a small
research reactor developed by \gls{usnc} \cite{noauthor_university_2021}. This reactor
alone is not nearly enough to meet all campus energy demands. Therefore, subesquent
additions of nuclear capacity are necessary to meet demands. The dearth of
technology options for steam production is genuine. However, the University may
pursue other heating methods \textit{besides} steam, such as retrofitting all
campus buildings with electric heaters or heat pumps. The cost of such a retrofit
is beyond the scope of this work.

Lastly, this model excludes the transportation sector of campus since that sector
is responsible for less than 5\% of all emissions
\cite{institute_for_sustainability_energy_and_environment_illinois_2020}. However,
as the energy sector reduces emissions, the transportation sector will make up a
more significant portion of total carbon emissions. The last few tons of carbon
will be the most difficult to curtail. In any case, achieving true carbon
neutrality is an ambitious and costly endeavor.
