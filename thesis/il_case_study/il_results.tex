This chapter presents the results of the Illinois case study. In all cases, the
energy system produces zero carbon emissions by 2030, consistent with the Illinois
government's stated policy goals
\cite{harmon_climate_2021,office_of_governor_jb_pritzker_gov_2021}.
\section{Sensitivity to Time Resolution}
\label{section:time_res}

First, I examined the influence of time resolution on model results for four
unique scenarios. Table \ref{tab:time-slices} describes the total number of
time-slices in each model run.

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \caption{Summary of Time-slices}
  \label{tab:time-slices}
  \begin{tabular}{lrrr}
    \toprule
    Title & Hours & Seasons & Time-slices \\
    \midrule
    Seasonal & 24 & 4 & 96\\
    Monthly & 24 & 12 & 288\\
    Weekly & 24 & 52 & 1248\\
    Daily & 24 & 365 & 8760\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
The sensitivity to time resolution reflects the sensitivity to \textit{intra-year}
variability.

\subsection{Least Cost Scenario}

There are no technology constraints in the ``Least Cost'' scenario, shown in Figure \ref{fig:time_res_LC}. When the model uses only 96 time-slices,
the results show that Illinois' cheapest path to net-zero electricity uses
only solar, wind, and battery storage to replace fossil fuels. This path includes
a significant over-build of wind and solar capacity that is either stored
or curtailed. The combined penetration (the fraction of total generation)
of solar, wind, and storage, reaches almost 60\% in this model run. The installed
capacity of solar and wind are comparable. Notably, the battery storage
required to ensure grid reliability in this scenario is 14.5 GW of power with
a 4-hour duration by 2030. This battery capacity exceeds California's current
battery capacity thirtyfold \cite{hutchins_us_2021}.

With a slightly improved time resolution, 288 time-slices, the cheapest pathway
for net-zero electricity includes a modest addition of advanced nuclear capacity.
Due to the assumed high capacity factor of advanced nuclear, the penetration of
solar and wind decreases by almost half. The addition of advanced nuclear also significantly
reduces battery storage requirements. Further, wind power's share of installed renewable
capacity drops from half to a third.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{0.95\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/time_resolution_plot_LC.pgf}}
  \caption{Impact of time resolution on the least cost results. Each year has four bars where
  each bar represents a different time resolution. Left to right, the time resolutions are: 4
  seasons, 12 months, 52 weeks, 365 days.}
  \label{fig:time_res_LC}
\end{figure}

Increasing the time resolution to 52 representative days (one for
each week) decreased the share of intermittent renewables and increased advanced
nuclear capacity. The percentage of renewable capacity from wind dropped to
just over a quarter of the total renewable capacity. This simulation installed
the least total capacity and doubled nuclear power capacity by 2050.
The daily resolution is somewhat different since the total capacity increases.
However, the relative share of renewable technology changes very little. This is
because the reduction in wind capacity is met with an increase in solar
panels.

The total discharge from batteries decreases with greater time resolution because
the share of generation from intermittent sources decreases concomitantly. Thus
there is less total load that needs to be shifted. The battery capacity \textit{increases}
at the highest resolution because there moments when more instantaneous power is
required.

\subsection{Expensive Nuclear and Zero Advanced Nuclear Scenarios}

Figure \ref{fig:time_res_ZAN} and Figure \ref{fig:time_res_XN} show the sensitivities of
``Expensive Nuclear'' and ``Zero Advanced Nuclear'' scenarios to time resolution.
The results are identical for these two scenarios at time resolutions less than
full year because doubling the capital cost of advanced nuclear has an effect similar
to explicitly prohibiting it in these scenarios.
There are three noticeable trends shared by Figure \ref{fig:time_res_ZAN} and Figure
\ref{fig:time_res_XN} for the first three time resolutions.
 First, the total capacity and generation increase as time resolution improves.
Second, the share of renewable capacity from wind decreases with improved time resolution.
Third, necessary battery storage increases significantly with a greater number of time-
slices. These trends appear because higher temporal resolutions capture more
variability in solar and wind resources. Additionally, the model installed 1.5 GW
of biomass-fired power plants at a weekly resolution. Although scarcely used,
this capacity served as a back-up when renewable sources and stored energy were
insufficient.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{0.95\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/time_resolution_plot_ZAN.pgf}}
  \caption{Impact of time resolution on the zero advanced nuclear scenario.
  Each year has four bars where each bar represents a different time resolution.
  Left to right, the time resolutions are: 4 seasons, 12 months, 52 weeks, 365 days.}
  \label{fig:time_res_ZAN}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{0.95\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/time_resolution_plot_XN.pgf}}
  \caption{Impact of time resolution on the expensive nuclear scenario.
  Each year has four bars where each bar represents a different time resolution.
  Left to right, the time resolutions are: 4 seasons, 12 months, 52 weeks, 365 days.}
  \label{fig:time_res_XN}
\end{figure}

These two scenarios diverge dramatically when simulated with a full year of hourly
resolution. The ZAN scenario continues on the same trajectory as before: more total capacity
and less wind penetration. However, biomass plays
a significant role in providing baseload power at this fine temporal resolution.
The XN scenario introduces advanced nuclear reactor and biomass power plants, and
thus the total capacity drops significantly.  This new nuclear capacity, along
with biomass, displaces much of the
renewable energy capacity. The difference between them is exclusively the policy
towards advanced nuclear technology. This difference appears slight since the less
time-resolved simulations were identical and the two policies function as obstacles
towards developing a new nuclear fleet. However, the small difference in policies
led to significant changes in capacity expansion.

\subsection{Nuclear Phaseout Scenario}
The final scenario considered was the ``Nuclear Phaseout'' scenario. Advanced
nuclear is explicitly disallowed here, and the existing Illinois nuclear fleet is shut down by
2050. These constraints match the ``100\% renewable energy'' language in the 2021
\gls{ceja} bill \cite{harmon_climate_2021}. Figure \ref{fig:time_res_ZN} shows
the time-sensitivity results for this scenario.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{0.95\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/time_resolution_plot_ZN.pgf}}
  \caption{Impact of time resolution on the nuclear phaseout scenario.  Each
  year has four bars where each bar represents a different time resolution.
  Left to right, the time resolutions are: 4 seasons, 12 months, 52 weeks, 365 days.}
  \label{fig:time_res_ZN}
\end{figure}

The same three trends observed in the ZAN scenario are repeated and
more pronounced in a total nuclear phaseout. The model dramatically overestimates
wind penetration at low time resolution and underestimates the necessary battery capacity.
Additionally, significant biomass capacity is needed to provide baseload
power in the daily time resolution.
In this scenario, the required battery capacity more than doubles from 26 GW in the
seasonal resolution to 58 GW in weekly and daily resolutions. Illinois would need 29 GW of 4-hour
storage by 2030 to preserve grid reliability without its existing nuclear plants.
That is 58 times the current storage capacity of California and more than
14 times the storage capacity of the entire United States
\cite{hutchins_us_2021}.
Biomass provides a more significant amount of baseload power, 27 GW at the highest
time resolution, than in the ZAN scenario.

\subsection{Scenario Comparisons}
This sensitivity analysis showed the strong influence of intra-year variability
and time resolution on model results.
Figure \ref{fig:time_res_cost} shows the differences between total system costs
for each scenario and time resolution.


\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{0.75\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/time_res_cost_plot.pgf}}
  \caption{Impact of time resolution on the objective function for each scenario.}
  \label{fig:time_res_cost}
\end{figure}

In all cases, the total system cost increases with time resolution. The ``Least
Cost'' scenario is appropriately named since it had the lowest total cost
of all scenarios. The XN and ZAN scenarios share virtually identical cost curves,
with a very slight difference in cost with 8760 time-slices. Since these scenarios
are so close in cost but have divergent energy futures, they could represent
alternatives in terms of other unmodeled objectives, such as social acceptance,
along with policy differences. Completely phasing out Illinois' existing nuclear
fleet leads to much higher costs in all scenarios.


% \subsection{Discussion of Time Resolution}
Table \ref{tab:time_res_clock} shows the
wall-clock time for each simulation, illustrating the tradeoff between model
complexity and computational cost.

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \caption{Wall-clock run time for each simulation in seconds}
  \label{tab:time_res_clock}
  \begin{tabular}{l*{4}{r}}
    \toprule
    & \multicolumn{4}{c}{Number of Time Slices}\\
    Scenario & 96 & 288 & 1248&8760\\
    \midrule
    LC &13.27&50.47&481.03&18566.30\\
    XAN &10.49&41.96&373.20&29152.75\\
    ZAN &9.87&36.69&280.86&9963.13\\
    ZN & 10.57&37.80&223.87&7908.50\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The computing time increases with both the temporal resolution and the number of
decision variables. The XAN scenario with 8760 time-slices had the most decision
variables since the model considered coal and natural gas with CCS and therefore took
the longest.

Table \ref{tab:relative_error} shows the relative error for each simulation with
respect to the daily resolution. There are two commonalities across all scenarios
and time resolutions.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The penetration of wind energy is greatly overestimated.
  \item Except when explicitly disallowed, preserving Illinois' existing nuclear
  fleet is the most cost-effective way to decarbonize Illinois' electric sector.
\end{enumerate}
In most other cases, solar power is underestimated since wind power is partially
replaced by solar. The exception to this is the XAN scenario, which overestimates
solar power because the model introduces advanced nuclear at the highest time resolution.
Scenarios without advanced nuclear energy vastly underestimate the importance of
baseload power and therefore underestimate the role of biomass in those cases.
Advanced nuclear is preferred over biomass due to its higher capacity factor and lower
fuel costs.

\section{Sensitivity to Resource Availability}
\label{section:resource_sa}

Typical \gls{esom} studies perform sensitivity analysis over cost parameters and
attempt to capture the variability of renewable energy sources using time-slice
aggregation. However, even well-chosen time-slices fail to capture the total variability
of wind and solar because models, like \gls{temoa}, treat each year in a model
horizon as identical \cite{hunter_modeling_2013}. In the present analysis, the
sensitivities of electricity cost and capacity expansion to renewable resource
availability are explicitly considered using a weekly resolution and a unique combination
of solar and wind data in each model run. By doing this analysis, we can develop
a hedging strategy that avoids costly power outages and ensures grid reliability.
I used a weekly time resolution to ensure computational tractability.

Figure \ref{fig:obj_cost_plot} shows the spread of electricity cost for each scenario.
The mean price of electricity in the Least Cost scenario is 16 percent less than
the XAN or ZAN scenarios and 28 percent cheaper than the Nuclear Phaseout scenario.
Additionally, the variance is far less in the Least Cost scenario than the other
three scenarios. The XAN and ZAN scenarios are virtually identical
except for a subset of simulations at the high end of the system cost. The maximum
system cost is slightly lower for the XAN scenario than in ZAN because advanced
nuclear is not explicitly disallowed.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{0.95\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/obj_cost_plot.pgf}}
  \caption{Sensitivity of the levelized cost of electricity to variability of
   solar and wind resources.}
  \label{fig:obj_cost_plot}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:il_capacity} shows how resource availability affects capacity
expansion. As shown previously in Section \ref{section:time_res}, the LC scenario
has the lowest total capacity because most of the generation comes from firm nuclear
power. The nuclear-constrained scenarios in Figure \ref{fig:il_capacity} also
highlight the necessity of on-demand back-up capacity. Biomass plants serve that role
in the ZN, ZAN, and XAN scenarios. The mean biomass capacity is higher
in the ZAN scenario than in XAN because the latter allows advanced nuclear. Since
this sensitivity study only uses a weekly time resolution, all three nuclear-constrained scenarios
underestimate the role of baseload power, as shown in Table \ref{tab:relative_error}.
The uncertainty in renewable energy capacity is also much higher for these three scenarios.


\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{0.95\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/capacity_sensitivity.pgf}}
  \caption{Sensitivity of the installed capacity to variability of
   solar and wind resources.}
  \label{fig:il_capacity}
\end{figure}

The XAN case simulates the
\textit{expectation} of significant cost overruns for every reactor build. Even so,
with only a weekly resolution there are scenarios where building advanced reactors
is advantageous in the XAN case. These results likely underestimate the role of
advanced nuclear since advanced nuclear showed up in the XAN case for 8760
time-slices, where it was previously not needed, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:time_res_XN}.

\section{Discussion and Policy Implications}

The fundamental question in capacity expansion problems is: How much capacity is enough?
\glspl{esom} attempt to answer this question while balancing other priorities such
as reducing carbon emissions and ensuring grid reliability. Many studies address
deep uncertainties surrounding future costs
\cite{alzbutas_uncertainty_2012,barron_differential_2015,komiyama_energy_2015,
li_open_2020,yue_least_2020} or different energy and climate policies \cite{bennett_extending_2021,
bouckaert_expanding_2014,de_sisternes_value_2016,decarolis_modelling_2016,neumann_near-optimal_2021,
seck_embedding_2020} by evaluating a set of cases, Monte Carlo sampling cost distributions,
or using \gls{mga}. Virtually all of these studies include intermittent renewable
energy in the model, but none treat the annual variability of solar and wind
as an uncertain parameter, nor do they consider the effect of time resolution on
model results. The purpose of these analyses was to address precisely that issue.

Figure \ref{fig:obj_cost_plot} and Figure \ref{fig:il_capacity} clarify
two points. First, including firm nuclear capacity has the greatest positive
influence on both the certainty and the mean of system levelized cost. Relying primarily
on intermittent renewables increases both the mean and uncertainty of electricity cost.
Second, the fundamental question of \glspl{esom} is unanswerable without firm nuclear capacity.
As the penetration of intermittent renewables increases, so does the uncertainty around
capacity expansion. This pattern likely continues at a full-year hourly time resolution
since the model underestimates total capacity in every case, except for the XAN scenario.
I modeled biomass as an alternative firm capacity option. The mean biomass in all
nuclear-constrained scenarios is greater than 5 GW. Which Table \ref{tab:relative_error}
shows is a significant underestimate! \gls{nrel} calculated Illinois technical potential
for biomass electricity production at 4 GW, the highest of any state \cite{lopez_us_2012}.
These results indicate a greater capacity requirement than Illinois' technical potential,
suggesting either greater renewable and storage capacity or requiring advanced
nuclear reactors. Due to large uncertainties, the renewable capacity requirement
will never be clear.

The minimum hedging strategy for decarbonizing Illinois' electricity is preserving
the existing nuclear fleet since the entire nuclear capacity is present in all
simulations and resolutions unless explicitly limited. A further
hedging strategy would be to lift the moratorium on new nuclear plants in Illinois
since advanced nuclear reactors are built, even when the capital cost doubles, unless
explicitly limited. Further, the results in Figure \ref{fig:time_res_LC}, from the
Least Cost scenario, show that solar energy is a good investment and may couple well
with advanced nuclear reactors. Further investments in wind power should be
considered carefully or eliminated altogether.

As outlined in section \ref{section:energy_policy}, good energy policies should
ensure reliability, affordability, and sustainability. The results in section
\ref{section:time_res} and section \ref{section:resource_sa} challenge the
current Illinois energy policy described in \gls{ceja}.

Figure \ref{fig:compare_ceja} compares the 2030 Illinois capacity expansion
for each scenario in the present work with the current Illinois policy.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{0.85\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/il_scenario_comparison_2030.pgf}}
  \caption{The installed carbon free electric generating capacity by 2030 in
  each modeled scenario with daily resolution and Illinois' target capacity outlined
  in \gls{ceja}. Existing natural gas and coal capacity are not shown since their
  use should be eliminated by 2030.}
  \label{fig:compare_ceja}
\end{figure}

\gls{ceja} is a tremendous step in the right direction and makes Illinois a leader
on climate change. In particular, \gls{ceja} provided subsidies for ``zero
emissions facilities'' (nuclear power plants) that reversed plans to shutter Byron
and Dresden Nuclear Plants prematurely \cite{harmon_climate_2021,brown_two_2021}.
However, it is clear from this figure that the specific numbers recommended in
\gls{ceja} were not motivated by a robust energy system analysis. In every model
scenario, the total CEJA target capacity falls far short of capacity expansion.
CEJA's solar and wind capacities are comparable to those
in the "Least Cost" scenario but do not include firm capacity from
advanced nuclear nor sufficient energy storage to guarantee reliability.  Further, the
renewable energy targets are far lower than in the nuclear-constrained scenarios.
The authors of \gls{ceja}'s capacity targets, the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition,
assumed that Illinois would end electricity exports, reducing electricity generation
to around 75\% of its current value and that electricity demand will remain constant
through 2030 \cite{the_accelerate_group_clean_2019}. Skeptics may therefore argue
that the present comparison is unfair since the modeled scenarios preserve Illinois
status as a net-exporter and include a 1\% annual growth in electricity demand.
However, these differences highlight the deficiencies of Illinois' current
clean energy policies. Decarbonizing every economic sector will require
at least some amount of electrification. Even with rapid technology adoption and
energy efficiency measures, electrification of other energy sectors leads to greater
electricity demand \cite{mai_electrification_2018}. Further, ending electricity
exports will force neighboring states to build more generating capacity or use
their fossil fuel reserves more regularly, counterproductive to reducing
carbon emissions.

By neglecting the vital role of clean firm capacity, \gls{ceja} cannot guarantee
reliable electricity and simultaneously enforce a carbon-free electric grid. This oversight
means \gls{ceja} fails the first criterion for sound energy policy. Related to grid
reliability, higher penetrations of solar and wind, without sufficient energy
storage, lead to greater price volatility \cite{winkler_impact_2016, blazquez_renewable_2018}
and more energy poverty \cite{henry_how_2021}. Thus \gls{ceja} does not ensure energy
affordability and does not meet the second criterion for a good energy policy. Since
\gls{ceja} cannot guarantee reliability or affordability with its current capacity
targets, Illinois may be forced to use fossil fuels as energy back-up. Without
clean firm capacity options or sufficient energy storage, \gls{ceja} locks in
fossil fuel dependence and misses the sustainability criterion for a good energy policy.
Although the \gls{ceja}'s passage into law is an encouraging indicator of Illinois
legislators' commitment to climate action, the bill does not go far enough. Future
policies in Illinois should lift the moratorium on new nuclear facilities and
continue subsidizing these ``zero emissions facilities'' as recommended by
Blazquez et al. 2018 \cite{blazquez_renewable_2018}.

\section{Limitations to the Model}

There are several limitations to the model used in this analysis. Some are related
to model assumptions and others to model structure. First, the sensitivity analysis
in Section \ref{section:time_res} only aggregated time series with averaging. I
chose this method due to its simplicity. Kotzur et al. 2018 found that averaging
produced the most error with respect to a reference case with a full year of
hourly data \cite{kotzur_impact_2018}. Selecting time-slices using another algorithm,
such as k-means, significantly reduced error. However, Kotzur et al. only tested a single
year of data rather than conducting a sensitivity analysis as in section
\ref{section:resource_sa}. All aggregation methods are subject to error. Choosing
a simple time series aggregation approach may be forgiven in this case since section
\ref{section:time_res} includes a reference case (daily resolution) to compare against.
Superior temporal aggregation methods are necessary for models with enough
spatial and topological complexity that a fully time-resolved reference case is
computationally intractable.

Second, the model has no spatial resolution, effectively treating Illinois as a
climatically homogenous region. \gls{temoa} includes functionality for regional
analysis, but there is no simple way to integrate spatial data, such
as data from Geographical Information Systems (GIS) \cite{martinez-gordon_review_2021}.
Like temporal aggregation, spatial aggregation is often the default approach in
\gls{esom} studies due to modelers' preferences for topological complexity and
technology options \cite{martinez-gordon_review_2021,poncelet_impact_2016}. Spatial
aggregation leads to the loss of suitable sites for wind and solar energy that could
reduce the impact of their intermittency \cite{fleischer_minimising_2020}. However,
no studies have compared the conflicting influences of spatial and temporal complexity.

Due to the lack of spatial resolution, the cost of additional transmission lines
is not modeled. This is somewhat less important for scenarios with significant
baseload capacity from advanced nuclear reactors or biomass since those technologies
could be sited at retired coal or natural gas plants, as in Wyoming
\cite{associated_press_bill_2021}. In the case of solar panels, programs like Solar
For All and Illinois Shines \cite{chicago_illinois_nodate, noauthor_illinois_nodate}
could put all of the solar capacity on consumers' rooftops \cite{lopez_us_2012},
eliminating the need for additional transmission if they are all grid-connected.

Third, this model uses a planning reserve margin to ensure sufficient
excess capacity to guarantee grid reliability. However, this measure of reliability
is less helpful for grids that depend heavily on intermittent and variable sources
of electricity. Two systems with identical \glspl{prm} may not be equally reliable.
I used the FERC-recommended \gls{prm} of 15 percent, which may be
an underestimate for grids with high renewable penetration \cite{milligan_methods_2011}.
Further, because \gls{temoa} always builds enough capacity to satisfy the demand
constraint at all time-slices, the model does not consider the cost of
importing electricity when there is insufficient in-state generation. However,
this issue is insignificant because Illinois is a net exporter of electricity
\cite{energy_information_administration_eia_nodate}.

Lastly, the model has limited technology options. The dearth of options for
firm capacity reflects genuine physical limitations, as discussed in section
\ref{section:alt_firm}.However, other energy storage options such as
molten salt, flywheels, and hydrogen storage are less technically mature
than lithium-ion batteries but could play a role in the future.
