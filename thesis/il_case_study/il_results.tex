This chapter presents the results of the Illinois case study. In all cases, the
energy system produces zero carbon emissions by 2030, consistent with the Illinois
government's stated policy goals
\cite{harmon_climate_2021,office_of_governor_jb_pritzker_gov_2021}.
\section{Sensitivity to Time Resolution}
\label{section:time_res}

First, I examined the influence of time resolution on model results for four
unique scenarios. The total number of time-slices in each model run is
described in Table \ref{tab:time-slices}.

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \caption{Summary of Time-slices}
  \label{tab:time-slices}
  \begin{tabular}{lrrr}
    \toprule
    Title & Hours & Seasons & Time-slices \\
    \midrule
    Seasonal & 24 & 4 & 96\\
    Monthly & 24 & 12 & 288\\
    Weekly & 24 & 52 & 1248\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
In the ``Least Cost'' scenario, shown in Figure \ref{fig:time_res_LC},
there are no technology constraints. When the model uses only 96 time-slices,
the results show that cheapest path to net-zero electricity in Illinois uses
only solar, wind, and battery storage to replace fossil fuels. This includes
a significant over-build of wind and solar capacity that is either stored
or curtailed. The combined penetration (the fraction of total generation)
of solar, wind, and storage, reaches almost 60\% in this model run. The installed
capacity of solar and wind are comparable. Importantly, the battery storage
required to ensure grid reliability in this scenario is 14.5 GW of power with
a 4-hour duration by 2030. This battery capacity exceeds California's current
battery capacity thirty fold \cite{hutchins_us_2021}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering

  \caption{Impact of time resolution on the least cost results. Each year has three bars where
  each bar represents a different time resolution. Left to right, the time resolutions are: 4
  seasons, 12 months, and 52 weeks.}
  \label{fig:time_res_LC}
\end{figure}
With a slightly improved time resolution, 288 time slices, the cheapest pathway
for net-zero electricity includes a modest addition of advanced nuclear capacity.
Due to the assumed high capacity factor of advanced nuclear, the penetration of
solar and wind is roughly halved. The addition of advanced nuclear also significantly
reduces battery storage requirements. Further, the share of installed renewable
capacity from wind drops from half to a third.

Finally, by increasing the time resolution to 52 representative days (one for
each week) the share of intermittent renewables drops further, replaced by
advanced nuclear. The share of renewable capacity from wind dropped again to
just over a quarter of the total renewable capacity. This simulation installed
the least total capacity and doubled the capacity of nuclear power by 2050.
The one common feature at every time resolution was the persistence of Illinois'
existing nuclear fleet.

The sensitivities of ``Expensive Nuclear'' and ``Zero Advanced Nuclear'' scenarios
to time resolution are both shown in Figure \ref{fig:time_res_ZAN}. The results
are identical for these two scenarios because doubling the capital cost of
advanced nuclear had the same effect as explicitly prohibiting it, in these scenarios.
There are three noticable trends in Figure \ref{fig:time_res_ZAN} as time resolution
increases. First, the total capacity and generation increase as time resolution improves.
Second, the share of renewable capacity from wind decreases with improved time resolution.
Third, necessary battery storage increases significantly with a greater number of time-
slices. These trends appear because higher temporal resolutions capture more
variability in solar and wind resources. Additionally, at a weekly resolution, the
model installed 1.5 GW of biomass fired power plants. Although scarcely used,
this capacity served as a back-up when renewable sources and stored energy are
insufficient.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{0.95\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/time_resolution_plot_ZAN.pgf}}
  \caption{Impact of time resolution on the expensive nuclear and zero advanced nuclear
  scenarios. Each year has three columns where each column represents a different time
  resolution. Left to right, the time resolutions are: 4 seasons, 12 months, and 52 weeks.}
  \label{fig:time_res_ZAN}
\end{figure}

As in the ``Least Cost'' scenario, Illinois' existing nuclear fleet persists in
both the ``Expensive Nuclear'' and ``Zero Advanced Nuclear'' scenarios.

The final scenario considered was the ``Nuclear Phaseout'' scenario. Here, advanced
nuclear is explicitly disallowed and the existing Illinois nuclear fleet is shut down by
2050. This matches the ``100\% renewable energy'' language in the 2021 \gls{ceja} bill
\cite{harmon_climate_2021}. Figure \ref{fig:time_res_ZN} shows the time sensitivity
results for this scenario.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{0.95\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/time_resolution_plot_ZN.pgf}}
  \caption{Impact of time resolution on the nuclear phaseout scenario. Each year has three
  columns where each column represents a different time resolution. Left to right, the time
  resolutions are: 4 seasons, 12 months, and 52 weeks.}
  \label{fig:time_res_ZN}
\end{figure}

The same three trends observed in the ZAN and XN scenarios are repeated, and
more pronounced, in a total nuclear phaseout. Wind penetration is greatly overestimated
with low time resolution and the necessary battery capacity is greatly underestimated.
In this scenario, the required battery capacity doubles from seasonal resolution to
weekly resolution. At the latter resolution, Illinois would need 29 GW of 4-hour
storage by 2030 to preserve grid reliability. That's 58 times the existing storage capacity
of California, and more than 14 times the storage capcity of the entire United States
\cite{hutchins_us_2021}.

In all cases, natural gas and coal plants do not operate beyond 2025
and those plants close at the end of their functional lives. In reality, they could be
shuttered sooner if that capacity is not needed for back-up generation.



\subsection{Discussion of Time Resolution}
The results presented in section \ref{section:time_res} are consistent with findings
of Poncelet et al. 2016, that temporal resolution has a significant impact on model results.
However, Poncelet used up to 288 time slices for their model, while this work used
up to 1248 time slices and showed further impacts of time resolution. Table
\ref{tab:time_res_clock} shows the wall-clock time for each simulation, illustrating
tradeoff between model complexity and computational cost.

\section{Sensitivity to Resource Availability}

Typical \gls{esom} studies perform sensitivity analysis over cost parameters and
attempt to capture the variability of renewable energy sources using time-slice
aggregation. However, even well chosen time-slices fail to capture the full variability
of wind and solar because models, like \gls{temoa}, treat each year in a model
horizon as identical \cite{hunter_modeling_2013}. In the present analysis, the
sensitivities of electricity cost and capacity expansion to renewable resource
availability is explicitly considered using a weekly resolution and a unique combination
of solar and wind data in each model run. Figure \ref{fig:obj_cost_plot} shows
the spread of electricity cost for each scenario.

The mean price of electricity in the Least Cost scenario is 16 percent less than
the XN or ZAN scenarios and 28 percent cheaper than the Nuclear Phaseout scenario.
Additionally, the variance is greatly reduced in the Least Cost scenario compared
with the other three scenarios. The XN and ZAN scenarios are virtually identical
except for a subset of simulations at the high end of system cost. The maximum
system cost is slightly lower when advanced nuclear is costly, but allowed,
than when it's prohibited.

  \caption{Sensitivity of the levelized cost of electricity to variability of
   solar and wind resources.}
  \label{fig:obj_cost_plot}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:il_capacity} shows how resource availability affects capacity
expansion. As shown previously in Section \ref{section:time_res}, the LC scenario
has the lowest total capacity because most of the generation come from firm nuclear
power. The nuclear constrained scenarios in Figure \ref{fig:il_capacity} also
highlight the necessity of on-demand back up capacity. In the ZN, ZAN, and XN
scenarios, biomass plants serve that role. The uncertainty in renewable energy
capacity is much higher for each of these scenarios.
