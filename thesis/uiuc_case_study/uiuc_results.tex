The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign pledged to achieve net-zero carbon
emissions from all campus sectors by 2050
\cite{institute_for_sustainability_energy_and_environment_illinois_2015}. This
chapter presents the results of the \gls{uiuc} case study. Since Section
\ref{section:time_res} established the importance of time resolution in model results,
all simulations in this chapter use a 52-week time resolution. The sensitivity
analysis explores other feasible options for the university with \gls{mga} and
varies the \gls{mga} slack variable.

\section{Least Cost Pathway to Net-Zero}
Figure \ref{fig:uiuc_elc_cap} shows the annual capacity expansion in the cost
minimized solution. Notably, the capacity for all electric generating technologies
grows throughout the model horizon. In particular, the \texttt{ABBOTT\_TB} capacity
increases to just over 100 MW$_e$, even though Figure \ref{fig:uiuc_elc_gen}
shows its electric generation dropping to zero by 2050. This is likely due to
the model using \texttt{ABBOTT\_TB} to meet the planning reserve margin, even
though it is unused. Additionally, electric import capacity, \texttt{IMP\_ELC}, rises
to almost 120 MW and accounts for roughly 35\% of total electricity by 2050.
This result is consistent with the recommendation from the Campus Master Plan
\cite{affiliated_engineers_inc_utilities_2015}.

Lastly, the wind capacity immediately jumps to 100 MW by 2025. The model was
constrained to 100.5 MW because \gls{uiuc} has a power purchase agreement with
Rail Splitter Wind Farm, which has an existing capacity of 100.5 MW, for 8\% of
its output \cite{breitweiser_wind_2016}. That the model recommends 100 MW of
wind capacity reflects the fact that wind energy is cheap and that there is significant
built-in flexibility through other electricity imports.

Figure \ref{uiuc_thm_cap} and Figure \ref{fig:uiuc_chw_cap} show the capacities
for steam production and refrigeration, respectively. In this model, there is no
carbon-free alternative to produce steam besides a nuclear reactor. Figure
\ref{fig:uiuc_chw_cap} shows that chilled water capacity increases with annual
cooling demand and the chilled water storage is roughly constant.

\section{Alternative Pathways}

Common formulations of capacity expansion problems use linear programming to optimize
an objective function, usually system cost. However, these models often miss
other appealing options due to unmodeled, structural, uncertainty. \gls{mga}
works around this by relaxing the objective function according to a user-defined
slack variable and searching for near-optimal solutions in decision space. This
section presents the results for \gls{uiuc} using \gls{mga} to explore alternatives
pathways to net-zero carbon emissions.

Figure \ref{fig:uiuc_elc_mga} shows the \gls{mga} results for \gls{uiuc}'s electric
sector. The first column of Figure \ref{fig:uiuc_elc_mga} shows that a one percent
increase in system cost allows \gls{uiuc} to fully retire Abbott Power Plant's
natural gas turbines and does not require nuclear powered steam turbines, in exchange
for slightly higher solar capacity and electricity imports. All other \gls{mga}
and slack values have identical results for the electric sector.
This lack of unique alternatives is possibly the result of the capacity constraints on
wind and solar, and the limited set of technology options.

  to-generate alternatives. The x-axis ticks represent a different \gls{mga} run.
  The label indicates the run number and the value of the slack variable. For example,
  ``mga-1-1\%'' indicates the first \gls{mga} run with a one percent
  slack value. For reference, the cost minimized solution ``mga-0-x\%,'' is also
  plotted. Each row of panels corresponds to a different technology.}
  \label{fig:uiuc_elc_mga}
\end{figure}

The capacity limit for solar was set to 191 MW of photovoltaic cells, which corresponds
roughly to one-eighth of university owned land. The fact that installed solar capacity
is so far below this limit suggests that further increases in solar panels would
raise system costs beyond 20\% of the optimal solution.

Figure \ref{fig:uiuc_thm_mga} shows the \gls{mga} results for the steam sector
of \gls{uiuc}. Similar to the electric sector, these results change very little.
Allowing the system cost to increase by 1\% allows \gls{uiuc} to build additional
natural gas capacity, which is anathema to the goal of net-zero carbon emissions.
The nuclear capacity does not change at all. These two features are also caused
by a lack of technology options in the steam sector.

  \label{fig:uiuc_thm_mga}
\end{figure}

Finally, Figure \ref{fig:uiuc_chw_mga} shows the \gls{mga} runs for the chilled
water sector. As with the other two sectors, the chilled water sector lacks a
diverse set of technology options, leading to persistent results. However,
unique to this sector, the slack value changes the results. Increasing the slack
value shows a tradeoff between chilled water storage and electric chilling capacity.
The chilled water storage only decreases with slack value, which indicates an
important role for storage capacity.
