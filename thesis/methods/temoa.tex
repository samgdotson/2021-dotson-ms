\gls{temoa} is an open-source \gls{esom} developed at North Carolina State University.
Like other \glspl{esom}, \gls{temoa} uses linear programming to solve the optimal
least-cost solution while meeting various demand and capacity constraints \cite{hunter_modeling_2013}.
The key benefits of \gls{temoa} are its open-source code, data, and built-in
uncertainty analysis capabilities. These features reflect the need for greater
transparency in \gls{esom} modeling and robust assessment of future uncertainties
\cite{hunter_modeling_2013}. One of the key limitations of \glspl{esom} is that
they are inherently unverifiable. By making the data and source code open,
\gls{temoa} facilitates repeatability. ``The evidence for integrity is transparency''
\cite{decarolis_case_2012}. To that end, \gls{temoa} models are should be solvable
with open-source linear programming solvers like \texttt{COIN-OR} \cite{noauthor_coin-or_nodate},
or \texttt{GLPK} \cite{noauthor_glpk_nodate}. In this thesis, I used the \texttt{CBC}
solver from \texttt{COIN-OR} \cite{noauthor_cbc_2021}.

Another benefit of \gls{temoa} is its flexibility.
The tool is technology agnostic and is only concerned with flows and transformations
of commodities. User-defined time slices allow modelers to run a model, in theory,
at an arbitrarily high time resolution, restricted only by data availability and
computational resources. de Quieroz et al. (2019) used \gls{temoa} to run a
pseudo-unit commitment model to bridge the gap between the low time resolution,
multi-decadal horizons of \glspl{esom}, and the high time resolution, month-long
horizons of unit commitment models \cite{de_queiroz_repurposing_2019}.

\subsection{Mathematics of Temoa}

A single \gls{temoa} run minimizes the following objective function \cite{noauthor_preface_nodate},

\begin{align}
  C_{total} &= C_{loans} + C_{fixed} + C_{variable}
  \intertext{where}
  C_{loans} &= \text{the sum of all investment loan costs},\nonumber\\
  C_{fixed} &= \text{the sum of all fixed operating costs},\nonumber\\
  C_{variable} &= \text{the sum of all variable operating costs}.\nonumber
\end{align}
The most complicated of these terms is $C_{loans}$, which is calculated by,
\begin{align}
  C_{loans} &= \sum_{t,v \in \Theta_{IC}}{\left(\left[IC_{t,v}\cdot LA_{t,v} \cdot \frac{(1+GDR)^{P_0-v+1}\cdot (1-(1+GDR)^{-LLN_{t,v}})}{GDR} \cdot \frac{1-(1+GDR)^{-LPA_{t,v}}}{1-(1+GDR)^{-LP_{t,v}}}\right] \cdot \textbf{CAP}_{t,v}\right)}
  \intertext{where}
  t &= \text{the name index of a particular technology}, \nonumber\\
  v &= \text{the vintage (i.e. construction year) of a particular technology}, \nonumber\\
  \Theta_{IC} &= \text{the set of all technologies that have associated investment costs}, \nonumber\\
  IC_{t,v} &= \text{the investment cost for a particular technology and vintage (i.e. a ``process'')},\nonumber\\
  LA_{t,v} &= \text{the amortization of the loan},\nonumber\\
  &= \frac{DR_{t,v}}{1-(1+DR_{t,v})^{-LLN_{t,v}}} \forall \{t,v\} \in \Theta_{IC}\\
  DR_{t,v} &= \text{the process specific discount rate}, \nonumber\\
  GDR &= \text{the global discount rate, applied to all processes}, \nonumber\\
  P_0 &= \text{the first year in the simulation}, \nonumber\\
  P_{last} &= \text{the last year in the simulation}, \nonumber\\
  LLN_{t,v} &= \text{the loan lifetime of a process}, \nonumber\\
  LP_{t,v} &= \text{the total lifetime of a process}, \nonumber\\
  LPA_{t,v} &= \text{the active lifetime of a process}, \nonumber\\
  &= \min{\left(LP_{t,v}, \left(P_{last}-LP_{t,v}\right)\right)}\\
  \textbf{CAP}_{t,v} &= \text{the capacity of a process}.\nonumber
\end{align}
An important point in this formulation is that the loan period, $LLN_{t,v}$ only
influences the value of the objective function when the global discount rate
and the process specific discount rate take on unique values. The difference between
these two values is known as the ``hurdle rate.'' When the hurdle rate is zero
$C_{loans}$ is not a function of loan period. In the following case studies, I
do not specify a unique discount rate for each process. There is some work that
suggests a high discount rate may encourage capital intensive projects \cite{alzbutas_uncertainty_2012,
decarolis_modelling_2016}, but the effect of hurdle rates is beyond the scope of
this thesis. This objective function is also subject to various constraints that
guarantee energy demands are met at all times and, if specified, ensures respect
of capacity and emissions limits. The details of these constraints are available
at \href{https://temoacloud.com/temoaproject/Documentation.html#the-math-behind-temoa}{temoacloud.com}

\subsubsection{Modeling-to-Generate-Alternatives}
\gls{mga} enables systematic evaluation of structural uncertainty by probing
near-optimal decision space. \gls{temoa} uses the Hop-Skip-Jump (HSJ) algorithm for
\gls{mga}. The steps for HSJ are \cite{decarolis_modelling_2016}:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Obtain an optimal solution by any method.
  \item Add a user-specified amount of slack to objective function value from the
  first step.
  \item Use the adjusted objective function value as an upper bound constraint.
  \item Generate a new objective function that minimizes the sum of all decision
  variables.
  \item Iterate the procedure.
  \item Stop the \gls{mga} when no significant changes are observed.
\end{enumerate}
The mathematical formulation of this algorithm is:
\begin{align}
  \intertext{Minimize:}
  p &= \sum_{k\in K} x_k
  \intertext{Subject to:}
  f_j\left(\vec{x}\right) &\leq T_j \forall j\\
  \vec{x}&\in X
  \intertext{where}
  p &= \text{the new objective function}\nonumber\\
  x_k &= \text{the $k^{th}$ decision variable with a nonzero value in previous solutions}\nonumber\\
  f_j\left(\vec{x}\right) &= \text{the $j^{th}$ original objective function} \nonumber\\
  T_j &= \text{the slack-adjusted target value}\nonumber\\
  X &= \text{the set of all feasible solutions}.\nonumber
\end{align}
This procedure results in a small set of maximally different solutions for
modelers to interpret. In this way \gls{mga} efficiently explores decision space
to offer alternatives that may capture unmodeled objectives, such as political
expediency or social acceptance.

\subsection{Na\"{i}ve Pathway to 100\% Clean Energy: Linear Programming Example}
\label{section:naive-example}

This example illustrates the influence of both structural and parametric uncertainties and
how \gls{mga} probes decision space. As discussed in Section \ref{section:ceja},
the \gls{ceja} bill promises to make Illinois' electric grid 100\% clean energy
by 2030. According to the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition, 6.3 GW of additional wind energy
capacity and 17 GW of solar capacity should be enough to achieve this goal while
meeting Illinois' electricity demand \cite{the_accelerate_group_clean_2019}. The
Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition implicitly assumes the following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item All of Illinois' existing nuclear fleet will be operating in 2030.
  \item All fossil fuel plants will be replaced by wind or solar energy in 2030.
  \item Stagnant electricity demand.
  \item Zero electricity exports. Illinois currently exports approximately 24\%
  of its total generation \cite{energy_information_administration_eia_nodate}.
\end{enumerate}
In 2019, the electricity demand of Illinois was 138 TWh, and 98.7 TWh generated from
nuclear power \cite{energy_information_administration_eia_nodate}.
Formulated as a linear programming problem, Illinois must:
\begin{align}
  \intertext{Minimize:}
  C_{total} &= C_s x_1 + C_w x_2
  \intertext{Subject to:}
  D &\leq \left[CF_s x_1 + CF_w x_2\right]\cdot8.76
  \intertext{where}
  x_1 &= \text{capacity of solar (first decision variable), $\left[GW\right]$}\nonumber\\
  x_2 &= \text{capacity of wind (first decision variable), $\left[GW\right]$}\nonumber\\
  C_s &= \text{cost of solar $\approx 8.11$ $\left[\frac{B\$}{GW}\right]$} \nonumber\\
  C_w &= \text{cost of wind $\approx 1.411$ $\left[\frac{B\$}{GW}\right]$}\nonumber\\
  CF_s &= \text{capacity factor of solar $\approx 0.2$, $\left[\%\right]$}  \nonumber\\
  CF_w &= \text{capacity factor of wind, $\approx 0.35$ $\left[\%\right]$}  \nonumber\\
  D &= \text{remaining electricity demand $\approx 39.3$ $\left[TWh\right]$}\nonumber
\end{align}
Table \ref{tab:naive} summarizes the data for this toy problem. The capacity factor (CF)
is the ratio of energy produced by a generator and the energy it could have produced
if it operated 100\% of the time. CF is given by,
\begin{align}
  CF &= \frac{E_{tot}}{P_{np}*8.76}
  \intertext{where}
  E_{tot} &= \text{the total energy produced in a given year, $\left[TWh\right]$} \nonumber\\
  P_{np} &= \text{the nameplate capacity of a generator, $\left[GW\right]$}\nonumber\\
  8.76 &= \text{a factor that converts power in GW to energy in TWh}\nonumber.
\end{align}

\begin{table}[H]

  \caption{Summary of Solar and Wind Data}
  \label{tab:naive}
  \resizebox{0.75\textwidth}{!}{
  \input{methods/naive_ceja}
  }
\end{table}

This linear problem only has two decision variables, solar and wind capacity,
which makes it graphically solvable. Figure \ref{fig:mga-fig} shows the optimal
solution and one \gls{mga} iteration. As well as the \gls{ceja} goals, for reference.
Every point above the demand constraint represents a feasible solution, since
those are all combinations of solar and wind that can meet annual electricity
demand. The \gls{ceja} goals are well within the feasible region, but highly sub-optimal.
This amount of capacity suggests the energy could be exported, curtailed, or stored, which are
unmodeled, structural uncertainties, in this formulation.
The optimal solution minimizes the total cost and lies at the intersection
of the objective function and the demand constraint. The objective function cannot
be reduced any further because those solutions would not satisfy the electricity demand.
The \gls{mga} ``objective function'' added a 10\% slack to the original objective function
and becomes an additional upper bound constraint. The new objective function minimizes
the sum of solar and wind capacity. In this trivial case, the model will always build
solar over wind, unless the cost of wind becomes cheaper than the cost of solar.
However, the example illustrates \gls{mga} generally. Finally, although \gls{mga} scenarios
may account for either structural uncertainties or parametric uncertainties
\cite{decarolis_modelling_2016}, I use the former interpretation. This is because
\gls{mga} cannot specify which uncertain parameters led to a particular scenario.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{0.8\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/naive_mga.pgf}}
  \caption{The optimal solution lies at the intersection between the objective
  function (orange line) and the demand constraint (dashed blue line). An \gls{mga}
  iteration is shown by adding a 10\% slack to the objective function (black line).
  The red dot shows the \gls{ceja} goals for renewable energy, for reference.}
  \label{fig:mga-fig}
\end{figure}

While \gls{mga} helps modelers explore alternative energy futures and structural
uncertainty, quantifying parametric uncertainty is essential for creating robust insights
for policy decisions. Figure \ref{fig:param-fig} shows the same decision space for
the na\"{i}ve capacity expansion problem as before with upper and lower bounds for
the demand constraint and objective function with 10\% uncertainty applied to all
parameters. The upper bound for the demand constraint represents a scenario where
the capacity factors for wind and solar are both 10\% less than average and electricity
demand is 10\% higher. The upper and lower bounds on the objective function represent
futures where the cost of solar and wind energy is 10\% higher or lower than
projected, respectively. The CEJA capacity goal is identified by the red dot in
\ref{fig:param-fig}. There are several methods to explore this optimal space and
\gls{temoa} has some functionality for two: \gls{mca} \cite{yue_review_2018} and
stochastic optimization \cite{decarolis_multi-stage_2012, bennett_extending_2021}.
\gls{mca} is useful for global sensitivity analysis since its computational
cost increases with the number of iterations, but not the number of uncertain
parameters. However, \gls{mca} depends strongly on the underlying data distribution
and cannot give a likelihood for any given scenario \cite{yue_review_2018}.
Stochastic optimization offers a likelihood and a possible ``hedging'' strategy,
but computational cost limits the number of uncertain parameters that can be
tested \cite{yue_review_2018}.

  \resizebox{0.8\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/naive_parametric.pgf}}
  \caption{Decision space for the na\"{i}ve capacity expansion problem with
  10\% uncertainty applied to all parameters. The optimal space lies within
  overlapping blue and red regions. The red dot shows the \gls{ceja} goals for
  renewable energy, for reference.}
  \label{fig:param-fig}
\end{figure}
Considering the optimal mixture of wind and solar to achieve Illinois' clean
energy goals, in this manner, and comparing it to current policy trivializes the
problem. There are many features of energy systems no captured in this simple formulation,
like availability of solar power, need for back up or energy storage when weather
fails, and other clean technology options. Thus \glspl{esom} are necessary. However,
this example illustrates the \gls{mga} method and shows how the optimal space
expands under parametric uncertainties.

In the following case studies I apply \gls{mga} to explore near-optimal solutions
for the \gls{uiuc} energy system and a novel approach with \gls{raven} to study
the sensitivity of Illinois' grid to wind and solar capacity factor profiles and
time resolution.
