The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign operates a diverse microgrid to
deliver electricity, steam heat, and chilled water to virtually all of its
campus buildings. This combination of demands makes full decarbonization difficult.
Yet, UIUC adopted the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 for all energy sectors.

Figure \ref{fig:uiucsys} shows the topology of UIUCâ€™s energy system, modeled in Temoa.
The UIUC model is spatially simple, since there is only one region, but topologically
more complex than the Illinois model from Section \ref{section:ilmodel} with
three interconnected end-use demands.

\subsection{Model and Data}
All campus data were obtained from the Facilities and Services Department at \gls{uiuc}.
Cost and operational data were also retrieved from the \gls{uiuc} ''Utilities
Production and Distribution Master Plan'' \cite{affiliated_engineers_inc_utilities_2015}.

\subsubsection{Campus Steam}
\gls{uiuc} heats most of its buildings with steam generated by natural gas and
coal plant on campus, Abbott Power Plant. Abbott is a combined cycle facility that
can operate in a condensing mode to capture steam to generate electricity or an
extraction mode that sends steam to campus for heating
\cite{affiliated_engineers_inc_utilities_2015}. \gls{temoa} does not have a
convenient way to model combined cycle plants \cite{decarolis_temoa_2010}. The
\gls{temoa} team suggests splitting the output of the technology, however, this
forces the Abbott model to generate steam and electricity in a fixed ratio, which
is not how Abbott operates. I circumvent this issue by introducing a dummy technology,
\texttt{ABBOTT\_TB}, that converts steam to electricity. Thus, \gls{temoa} must
choose how to use the steam produced by Abbott, matching operational reality.
I modeled an on campus nuclear reactor in a similar manner. The nuclear reactor
generates a unique commodity, \texttt{NUC\_STM}, to distinguish nuclear activity
from Abbott's activity. Figure \ref{fig:historical-steam} shows hourly steam
demand from \gls{uiuc} fiscal years 2014 to 2019.
